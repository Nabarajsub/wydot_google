This report serves as a comprehensive overview of WYDOT's tireless endeavors, achievements, and ongoing role in shaping Wyoming's transportation.\n\nThroughout Wyoming's vast and diverse landscapes, our state transportation infrastructure is the backbone connecting us all. WYDOT's diligent efforts to maintain and improve our transportation system touch every corner of the state. That reach is so integral to Wyoming's operations that it is difficult to depict in a snapshot of numbers. For roads alone that's a 6,700-mile state-owned highway system—including more than 900 miles of interstate.\n\nWYDOT's mission is not just to build roads and bridges; it is to forge pathways that connect our communities, drive economic growth, and ensure the safety of every Wyomingite and traveler. This report delves into WYDOT's core responsibilities, illustrating the meticulous maintenance of our highway network, relentless pursuit of road safety, support of our rural airports, and strategic initiatives aimed at fostering economic development. You will find insights into how WYDOT is leveraging emerging technologies, adapting to new challenges, and preparing for the future.\n\nEach employee contributes to successfully implementing WYDOT's mission. I extend my appreciation to each of you for your work and daily dedication. It is essential to acknowledge the collaborative spirit that underpins WYDOT's success. WYDOT works hand in hand with local communities, businesses, and stakeholders, embodying the Wyoming spirit of self-reliance and cooperation. A few major successes WYDOT achieved in 2023 stand out to me:\n\n» Implemented a new weight-based closure system to improve safety and reduce collisions while keeping roads open and goods moving.\n» Received three competitive federal grants, including $26.6 million to build 365 truck parking spaces along I-80 in Evanston; $24.3 million to complete a wildlife crossing project south of Kemmerer; and $13 million to complete design for the new I-80/I-25 interchange.\n» Opened a new virtual lobby for Driver Services making waiting for your license more convenient.\n» Welcomed 10 new troopers to Wyoming highways—the guardians of the Cowboy State.\n\nI was also glad to appoint Darin Westby as WYDOT's director. He is a strategic leader who is guiding WYDOT's evolution to meet today's demands, plan for the future, and work with our stakeholders to better Wyoming.\n\nAs we reflect on the accomplishments and continue our pursuit of the challenges documented in these pages, let us take pride in WYDOT's pivotal role in shaping the infrastructure that binds us together. May this annual report inspire confidence in our shared journey toward a brighter, more connected future for the great state of Wyoming.\n\nMark Gordon\nGovernor of Wyoming\n\nPAGE 3\n",

        "text": "\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\nDirector Darin Westby, PE\n\n# DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE\n\nReflecting on my first year as WYDOT director, I am impressed by our employees and their dedication. Our mission is vital, yet despite everyone's daily reliance on a functioning transportation system, I have been surprised by how easily it is taken for granted. My hope is to draw attention to how integral our transportation system is and how it connects everything from Wyoming's top industries—energy, tourism, and agriculture—to daily destinations like work, school, and medical facilities.\n\nWYDOT serves all who travel Wyoming no matter how they get around, whether by car, truck, bike, bus, or plane. Our priority is ensuring everyone arrives safely, which is why our Strategic Highway Safety Plan now accounts for vulnerable road users. We also care about non-traditional road users, such as mule deer and pronghorn, which is why we work with our passionate state partners on tackling wildlife crossing projects. And our work has paid off—the recently completed Dry Piney wildlife crossings are showing promising results with cameras capturing hundreds of animals using the passages. WYDOT also received the largest award from the national 2023 Wildlife Crossing Pilot Program for wildlife crossing infrastructure along US 189 to accommodate new energy development in southwest Wyoming.\n\nWyoming's transportation system is complex and so is caring for it. No matter the weather, WYDOT keeps our infrastructure in the best possible condition. Whether plowing roads, applying millions of gallons of striping paint, or repairing guardrails and clearing right of ways, WYDOT is a proud steward of our infrastructure. Our teams strategically select and design projects that maximize safety and effectiveness given limited statewide funding and inflation. A notable project in 2023 was the Casper Marginal, which is a historically large project for WYDOT and will provide safer, more efficient traffic flow in one of Wyoming's most densely populated areas. I continue to be impressed with how WYDOT accomplishes such important projects despite increased workloads and staffing shortages.\n\nBeyond normal construction and maintenance duties, WYDOT innovates to meet challenges. In 2023, WYDOT's ingenuity took on the wind. Engineering teams finalized and tested a design for a new high mast light tower to ensure the new design withstands Wyoming's winds. Meanwhile, WYDOT began piloting the first phases of a high wind road closure system based on gross vehicle weight limits to better inform travelers and reduce blow-over crashes. WYDOT also educated the Wyoming Legislature on this issue, which resulted in legislation to increase the fines for those who violate high-wind closures.\n\nAnother notable aspect of WYDOT that often goes overlooked is our reach beyond roads and bridges. WYDOT is the steward of the statewide public safety interoperable radio communications system, WyoLink, as well as home to Wyoming Highway Patrol and Aeronautics. WYDOT also houses many transportation-related services, from administering driver's licenses to specialty plates. And perhaps the most unsung heroes are those WYDOT programs that serve the agency internally to ensure customer-facing services are as effective as possible.\n\nAs I continue to learn more about WYDOT, I want to keep educating others on our brand, especially the importance and impact of our mission and how we meet it every day. I also want to ensure transparency, both inside and outside the agency. Continuing to educate stakeholders and the public will help us obtain and maintain strategic partnerships and accomplish even more.\n\nI look forward to what new challenges and opportunities await our agency, and hope this annual report serves as a reminder of all WYDOT does for this great state.\n\nPAGE 4\n",

WYDOT uses its funding for the stewardship of Wyoming's transportation system and for providing transportation-related services.\n\n# FEDERAL VS. STATE FUNDING\n\nGiven Wyoming's small population and large swathes of federal land, WYDOT receives relatively more federal transportation funding per capita than most other states; however, federal dollars must be matched with non-federal dollars. WYDOT uses state funding as non-federal match to leverage federal dollars as well as provide other transportation services. In fiscal year (FY)2023, WYDOT received $433.8 million of Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funds, resulting in 84 projects let to construction.\n\n## FEDERAL VS. STATE HIGHWAY FUNDING COMPARISON\n\n|                   | Funding Comparison<br/>WY Average | Funding Comparison<br/>National Average |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| State Hwy Funds   | 27%                               | 69%                                     |\n| Federal Hwy Funds | 73%                               | 31%                                     |\n\n\n# REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES\n\nState funding from state fuel taxes, registrations, vehicle fees, and driver's licenses are used to match federal funds and provide funding for non-highway needs. WYDOT currently uses much of its overall resources (federal and state combined) for highway improvement, maintenance, and operations, but funds are also invested in aeronautics, Wyoming Highway Patrol (WHP), emergency communications, planning, and other transportation-related services.\n\n# FUEL TAX RECEIPTS AND REVENUE DISTRIBUTION\n\nWYDOT receives fuel tax receipts at both the federal and state levels. At $0.184 (gasoline) and $0.244 (diesel) the federal fuel tax rate has not changed since 1993, and money raised from these taxes is fed into the Federal Highway Trust Fund and distributed to states. WYDOT receives more revenue from federal fuel taxes than it provides. At the state level, WYDOT's fuel tax was last increased ($0.10) in 2013, and currently sits at $0.24 for both gasoline and diesel.\n\nWY has 1,264 IRP carriers (8,433 truck/3,375 trailer plates issued) and 1,264 IFTA carriers (8,581 IFTA decal sets issued).\n\nThrough the International Registration Plan (IRP) and International\n\nPAGE 7\n",

WYDOT also provides tools for our customers to plan safe, informed travel; and, if the worst should happen, WYDOT facilitates fast and effective response.\n\n# SAFETY STARTS WITH US\n\nLeading by example, WYDOT is constantly improving safety practices. In 2023, the Employee Safety Program implemented new and improved training based on workforce safety needs, including (in coordination with WHP) an active shooter training to hundreds of state employees. Employee Safety also developed new training for 2024, covering confined spaces, fall protection, trenching and excavation, and Narcan ®.\n\nEmployee Safety and district safety representatives (DSRs) pursue safety certifications to ensure they provide the best guidance to WYDOT employees. To this end, in 2023 WYDOT's safety team received the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Certified Safety and Health Official certification.\n\nIn addition to formal training, the districts, including their DSRs, complete shop and safety meetings to keep mechanics abreast of workplace changes and safety programs. These safety meetings include job safety analysis and other protocols to advance a safe working environment.\n\n# SAFETY DRIVES US\n\nFrom planning and design to maintenance and data collection, WYDOT keeps safety in mind. Improving safety starts with a plan, so in 2023 the Highway Safety Program updated the Strategic Highway Safety Plan to include vulnerable road users (bicyclists and pedestrians) for a more inclusive safety strategy.\n\nWYDOT employees congregating for excavation and trenching training\n\nPAGE 11\n",

To improve data analysis and provide public access to crash data, Highway Safety updated the Safety Portal in 2023 and provided data to safety partners. Additionally, Highway Safety and WHP also submitted timely, accurate crash reports.\n\nTOTAL FATALITIES BY YEAR (2018-2022)\n\n| Year | Fatalities |\n| ---- | ---------- |\n| 2018 | 111        |\n| 2019 | 147        |\n| 2020 | 127        |\n| 2021 | 110        |\n| 2022 | 134        |\n\n\nEvery WYDOT project shares the goal of creating a safer transportation system; however, safe travelers are the ultimate safety tool. To help promote positive safety behaviors, WYDOT provides funds through the Highway Safety Behavior Grant Program. In FY23, about $4.7 million of these behavioral safety grants were awarded for new projects—focusing on vulnerable road users, impaired driving, occupant protection, and roadside injury prevention. The awarded projects will be ready to implement next year. To further support safer drivers, WYDOT trains safer travelers, such as defensive driving courses provided by WHP. In 2023, WHP instructed 90 defensive driving classes with 797 students attending. Troopers also taught 172 safety presentations to schools, businesses, fairs, and other safety events. WYDOT also provides more focused training; for instance, the Motorcycle Safety Program trained 950 students, both new and existing riders, over 90 classes at eight locations statewide in 2023. To help travelers plan safer trips, WYDOT also provides many travel tools.\n\n# TRAVEL TOOLS\n\nWith quickly changing road conditions through most Wyoming seasons, WYDOT provides a variety of tools to help travelers stay informed and make a safe travel plan.\n\nDuring the winter, the Wyoming Travel Authorization Program (W-TAP) served 18,500 citizens, ensuring travelers reached their destinations safely with more than 15,000 W-TAP subscribers.

Notably, the Geographical Information System (GIS)/Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Program developed a new process for weight-based high-wind closures to promising results (to read more about this exciting project, see Project Highlights). To further enhance safety communications with road users, WYDOT's GIS/ITS team deployed connected vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) devices at about 75 locations along I-80 in 2023 as WYDOT continues to be a national leader in the C-V2X space.\n\n# EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nAlthough everyone prefers to avoid safety incidents, crashes still occur. As part of WYDOT's holistic safety approach, the department facilitates fast and efficient emergency response to minimize harm.\n\nThrough WyoLink—Wyoming's statewide, public safety interoperable radio communications system—WYDOT provides a vital communication tool for emergency responders and public safety agencies statewide. The system is interoperable, meaning that agencies can directly communicate with each other in larger scale events and operations. In FY23, WYDOT oversaw awards totaling $4.5 million in ARPA funds to local agencies to purchase new WyoLink equipment. Expansion continues for interoperable communications across adjacent state and cellular networks with WYDOT obtaining two FirstNet compact rapid deployable through a partnership with FirstNet to address coverage gaps and improve service.\n\nTo further enhance emergency communications, the Information Technology (IT) Program expanded use of the Cradlepoint IBR1700 trunk modems for WHP, which allow wireless connectivity to office infrastructure when a vehicle is within range of building WiFi. This connectivity supports higher speeds for offloading trooper video and WiFi connectivity for radios as a backup communication system for WyoLink. IT also implemented connectivity using the StarLink satellite system alongside cellular in the WHP command bus.\n\nIn another notable accomplishment for improved emergency response, after coordinating with other state and local entities, the Next Generation 911 (NG 911) GIS completed the Wyoming NG 911 GIS Data Model, which will further NG911 in the state.\n\n# ENFORCEMENT\n\nWHP's tireless efforts in enforcing Wyoming's laws on our roadways is a key piece to WYDOT's safety approach. WHP enhances public safety by patrolling Wyoming's highways, enforcing highway safety and state statutes, and performing criminal interdiction.\n\nIn 2023, WHP responded to 4,527 crashes and arrested 1,357 impaired drivers. Additionally, WHP stopped 58,958 vehicles and issued 42,892 citations for speeding, 1,260 for driving while license suspended, 328 for no child restraint, and 1,712 for no seatbelt. Troopers also issued 43,130 warnings for traffic violations and faulty equipment. WHP contacted 770,590 commercial vehicles weighing 324,701 and finding 39,551 to be overweight. Consequently, WHP issued 182,896 oversize/overweight permits collecting $10.543 million in fees. To enhance commercial vehicle safety, WHP inspected 12,627 commercial vehicles finding 7,708 out-of-service violations.\n\nCitizens also contributed to safer enforcement on our roads by contacting the Dispatch Center to report drunk driving and other suspicious behaviors. As a result, the Dispatch Center fielded 136,366 calls, including 2,931 Report Every Drunk Driver Immediately Reports, 1,316 Safe2Tell (anonymous tip reporting system) tips, and 6,060 calls for towing services.\n\nPAGE 13\n",

WYDOT uses asset management to maximize benefits with limited funding.\n\n# SYSTEM OVERVIEW\n\nWyoming's transportation system is vast and complex serving multimodal transportation—including roads, bridges, air travel, transit, pathway, and freight rail. Such an expansive system requires many different stewards, from WYDOT to cities, counties, transit providers, private industry, and more. WYDOT collaborates with other transportation stakeholders, including the public, to ensure a safe, efficient, and connected statewide transportation system.\n\n# ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\nFederal law requires WYDOT to develop and implement a risk-based Transportation Asset Management Plan to establish and track performance targets for infrastructure assets. As a result of WYDOT's relatively flat stateside funding, which limits the amount of federal dollars that can be leveraged, the department currently focuses on asset preservation rather than enhancements and expansion.\n\n| WYOMING FEDERAL-AID SYSTEM OVERVIEW | WYOMING FEDERAL-AID SYSTEM OVERVIEW |\n| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |\n| TOTAL PUBLIC ROAD MILES             | 30,247                              |\n| WY FEDERAL-AID SYSTEM MILES         | 7,970                               |\n| FEDERAL-AID NHS MILES               | 3,975                               |\n| NON-INTERSTATE NHS MILES            | 3,062                               |\n| INTERSTATE MILES                    | 913                                 |\n| OTHER FEDERAL-AID ROAD MILES        | 3,995                               |\n\n\nWYDOT uses asset management to guide project selection.

WYDOT uses PMS analysis to compile the list of recommended pavement sections and associated treatment strategies. WYDOT applies different pavement preservation treatments at strategic times, from resurfacing to reconstruction, to achieve an optimal benefit-cost—in other words, the best bang for the state's buck!\n\nWYDOT's design and construction team received the silver prize for the American Concrete Pavement Association's Annual National Excellence in Concrete Pavement Awards - Divided Highways (Rural) category for the concrete pavement placed on I-80 (Rock Springs to Rawlins).\n\nTo align with federal reporting, WYDOT uses a Pavement Quality Rating system that defines pavement sections as Good, Fair, or Poor. Overall, most interstate pavement is in Fair or Good condition while most non-interstate National Highway System (NHS) and non-NHS pavement is in Fair or Poor condition. WYDOT continually enhances pavement efficiency, reduces waste, and stretches funding to meet its pavement preservation goals. As part of these efforts, the Materials Program recycled 19.90 miles of roadway in southwest Wyoming in 2023 by using hot in-place recycling. The hot in-place recycling rehabilitates deteriorated pavements to correct surface distresses and preserve existing surface materials with minimal traveler impacts. Additionally, Materials followed an industry transition from traditional Portland cement to a newer, more sustainable Portland-limestone cement that uses limestone as a filler to reduce environmental impacts. These advancements are just some of the ways WYDOT continually innovates and improves pavement efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n## FY23 WYOMING PAVEMENT RATINGS BY SYSTEM\n\n|      | INTERSTATE | NON-INTERSTATE NHS | NON-NHS |\n| ---- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------- |\n| GOOD | 35%        | 20%                | 12%     |\n| FAIR | 40%        | 45%                | 68%     |\n| POOR | 25%        | 35%                | 20%     |\n\n\n# BRIDGES\n\nWYDOT uses a Bridge Management System (BMS) to select bridge projects and replacement candidates. Using National Highway Performance Program (NHPP) targets (in effect since May 20, 2017), WYDOT strategically selects bridge projects to achieve its targets of maintaining at least 10 percent of bridge deck area in good condition while ensuring no more than 10 percent is in poor condition for both NHS and non-NHS bridges. To meet performance targets, WYDOT diligently inspects structures, completing 1,537 routine inspections (1,047 on-system\n\n## FY23 WYOMING BRIDGE PERFORMANCE RATINGS BY SYSTEM\n\n|      | ALL NHS BRIDGES | ALL NON-NHS BRIDGES (STATE SYSTEM) | CITY/COUNTY BRIDGES |\n| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |\n| GOOD | 22%             | 28%                                | 32%                 |\n| FAIR | 75%             | 68%                                | 58%                 |\n| POOR | 3%              | 4%                                 | 10%                 |\n\n\nPAGE 16\n",

This work consisted of the following:\n\n*   8 bridge replacements\n*   37 bridge rehabilitations\n*   2 box culverts\n*   1 retaining wall\n*   3 miscellaneous structures\n\nWork for future bridge replacements also began, with the Geology Program completing drilling investigations for 17 bridge replacements. WYDOT will continue to leverage federal funding to replace bridges in poor condition.\n\n# WYOLINK\n\nOver 500 entities use WyoLink's 105 network radio sites, and new users are continually added. WyoLink users include:\n\n*   68 emergency medical services\n*   94 law enforcement agencies\n*   118 fire protection agencies\n*   144 local government agencies\n*   20 Wyoming state agencies\n*   44 educational institutions\n*   2 federal agencies\n*   11 out-of-state agencies\n*   19 private entities (mine rescue and Life Flights)\n*   Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Wind River Indian Reservation\n\nWyoLink has **105 network radio sites serving 16,000 users** and about **21.7M calls annually**\n\nThe Emergency Communications Program ensures the vital WyoLink system remains reliable for the life saving services that depend on it. As part of this ongoing effort, in 2023 Emergency Communications completed radio upgrades at 65 sites and across 50 percent of WYDOT mobile and portable radios.\n\n# AERONAUTICS\n\nWYDOT also applies asset management to airports to help facilitate safe and reliable air travel. The Engineering and Construction Program provides airport asset management with work continuing in 2023 on a statewide GIS-based airport pavement management program. To further improve aeronautics assets and air service, the Engineering and Construction Program also oversaw various projects to support Wyoming aviation, including the following:\n\n*   53 design, construction, and equipment acquisition projects\n*   21 navigational aid maintenance projects\n*   20 aviation encouragement projects\n*   7 marketing projects\n\nBeyond caring for physical airport infrastructure, WYDOT also oversees air service development. The Air Service Development Program helped fund nine air service agreements in FY23—five through the Air Service Enhancement Program (ASEP) and four through the Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA). The ASEP agreements provided air service for more than 136,000 passengers while the CPA\n\nPAGE 17\n",

The Design Section completed 67 design projects, and the Contracts and Estimates (C&E) team oversaw 68 highway contracts awarded (some for combined projects), with the majority awarded to in-state bidders. Projects averaged 2.3 bidders, which was a lower average than for previous years. Most highway contracts were federally funded (62 projects), and the total construction cost was $392 million—a notable $22 million increase over FY22.\n\nIt's a bird. It's a plane. No! It's the P&S plane! The survey crew flew 10 flights over the Padlock pit, collecting 1,194 photos over 380 acres, and used the Skydio 2+ drone over the Willey Scoria Pit (point cloud below) to collect 424 photos over 138 acres.\n\nOf the projects let to contract in FY23, the Highway Development Program worked on 10 interstate system projects, 2 wildlife projects, 11 HSIP projects, 2 emergency projects, 5 state and federal system bridge replacements and rehabilitations, and 5 maintenance projects. Looking to the future, WYDOT's Project Development Section prepared $183.8 million in projects for FY24 lettings and $238.6 million in projects ready for letting beyond FY24. To aid design work, the Photogrammetry and Surveys Section (P&S) provided terrain mapping, aerial photography, surveying, and data for designers and other programs. In 2023, this work involved the Photogrammetry Group compiling mapping for 58 projects, including work on 10 urban projects, 20 rural projects, 18 bridge projects, and 2 pit and quarries. The Surveys Group placed photo targets and collected data for aerial imagery on 13 projects. Further, P&S set 219 project control monuments on 22 projects, collected Global Positioning System (GPS) control data on 30 projects, and collected digital-level data for vertical control on 26 projects—providing valuable coordinates that are used for mapping, design, land surveying, and construction.\n\n# FY23 INTERSTATE PROJECTS BY SYSTEM\n\n| FY23 TOTAL PROJECTS LET ON INTERSTATE SYSTEM | FY23 TOTAL PROJECTS LET ON INTERSTATE SYSTEM |\n| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| I-90                                         | $23.90 M (14%)                               |\n| I-80                                         | $61.60 M (37%)                               |\n| I-25                                         | $80.40 M (49%)                               |\n| $165.9M                                      |                                              |\n\n\nTo further prepare for highway construction, the Right of Way Program (ROW) acquired 165 parcels on 39 projects in 2023, including the following acquisitions:\n\n*   31 parcels for Poplar Street in Casper\n*   15 parcels for Thermopolis-Meeteetse\n*   16 parcels for 3rd Street in Laramie\n*   14 parcels for Evanston streets\n\nPAGE 18\n",

This dedication to timely design work is shown in the 53 new consultant contracts issued by the Consultant Services Unit, with the majority (39) going to in-state firms—an 89 percent increase from FY22. In FY23, new contracts totaled $23.51 million for a 131 percent increase from FY22. Payments totaling $15.023 million were made on 115 agreements with 60 firms.\n\n# WYDOT GETS THE JOB DONE\n\nThrough 2023's historically brutal winter and short summer, WYDOT crews worked on vital projects to keep our transportation system in the best possible condition given funding and staffing constraints. Despite vacancies continuing to stretch crews, workers across WYDOT completed important construction and maintenance work.\n\n# CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS\n\nFrom mill and overlay projects to larger reconstructions, WYDOT completed many necessary improvements to ensure Wyoming's transportation infrastructure remains in good overall condition. District 1 administered roughly $61.2 million of work in FY23 with the highlight being the Curtis Street bridge replacement over I-80 in Laramie. The bridge was replaced in about 90 working days, an extraordinary accomplishment for Reiman Corp. and WYDOT. District 1 also completed several safety-focused projects including a pedestrian bridge repair in Cheyenne near McCormick Junior High and several urban systems projects in Cheyenne, Laramie, and Rawlins. District 2 focused on larger projects in the Casper area, including the Casper Marginal (see the Project Highlights section for more information on this exciting project) while finishing remaining bridge repairs and paving projects. District 3 let multiple construction projects while work continued on project already in progress, including the Snake River bridge reconstruction on WY 22 in Teton County along with the reconfiguration of the WY22/WY 390 intersection. District 4 saw 11 projects let to contract including Sheridan Main Street (costing about $17.955 million); I-90. Sundance to State Line Section ($15.16 million); I-25 Kaycee to Buffalo, District Boundary Section ($11.321 million); Buffalo to Gillette, Wildhorse Creek Section ($8.762 million); and 65 miles of mill and overlay projects. District 5 completed asphalt pavement overlays and chip seals for 10 out of the 18 projects completed in FY23. Other projects included slope flattening between Thermopolis and Worland (US 20/ WY 789); erosion repair on Chief Joseph Scenic Highway (WY 296); two bridge rehabilitations and the Cottonwood Creek bridge replacement; tunnel lighting in the US 14/16/20 tunnel west of Cody; pipe lining and siphon replacement; a guardrail project; traffic signal detection system installation in Cody; and a pedestrian pier/river channel repair south of Riverton.\n\nWY 22 and WY 390 intersection and bridge job in Jackson\n\nPAGE 19\n",

With crews spread thin, districts were generous with helping each other. District 5, for instance, provided snow removal assistance to other districts in Winter 2023. Using asset assessments, crews went to work to meet infrastructure quality thresholds, completing major fence and delineation repairs, irrigation and drainage work, erosion repair and control, and daily litter control and carcass removal.\n\n# TRAFFIC PROGRAMS\n\nWYDOT's Traffic Program, district traffic crews, and other programs are integral to ensuring Wyoming roads are safe and easily navigable. Notably in 2023, the Standards Unit helped bring WYDOT's roadside safety hardware into compliance with the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH). To advance safe and efficient traffic operations, the Traffic Program collected and provided turning movement analysis and capacity analysis to inform projects and ensure optimal traffic flow.\n\n**Striping** crews went to work applying paint as supply issues eased from previous years. The Traffic Program executed purchasing contracts for 282,250 gallons of paint and 964,000 pounds of glass beads for highway striping and provided mobile striping retroflective and striping details for numerous projects.\n\n**Signage** starts with the Sign Shop, which manufactured 4,893 signs in 2023. Traffic completed 82 projects that contained permanent signage and work zone traffic control while providing numerous operational sign layout requests. District sign crews stayed busy with sign inspections, repairs, and replacements. In District 2, crews repaired or replaced almost 800 signs; while in District 5, crews completed annual inspections for more than 5,000 highway signs.\n\nDistrict 4 striping operations\n\n**Signals and Lighting** were also a focus for traffic crews. Notably, the Traffic Program, Construction Program, and District 5 collaborated on important lighting system and ventilation system upgrades for the Cody tunnels in 2023. The new adaptive LED lighting system improves lighting conditions for drivers while using less power than the previous system, resulting in lower operating costs and improved safety for WYDOT traffic crews maintaining the system.\n\nPAGE 20\n",

NATURE\n\nLarge portions of Wyoming received above average snowfall during Winter 2023, with certain areas experiencing historical snow accumulations and significant traveler impacts. Carbon County received accumulations within the top 10 percent of historical snowfalls that closed roads and kept district crews busy. WYDOT crews assisted the City of Rawlins by shifting 136 personnel to bolster snow control efforts and eclipsing District 1's snow control budget by over $2 million. Despite a record winter, Mother Nature was merciful with a mild spring, yet WYDOT still monitored and mitigated landslides, flooding, and rock falls.\n\nWith the help of uncontrolled mapping by the Photogrammetry Group, the Geology Program determined how fast and how much movement occurred with P&S collecting aerial imagery on 34 landslides for geologists. To support monitoring, the Geology Program installed 5 new slope inclinometers, making for 208 total active slope inclinometers statewide.\n\nMonitoring led to swift mitigation on multiple landslides. During an existing slide repair on I-90 south of Sheridan, additional movement required further mitigation. Despite slides threatening to impede access to popular tourist destinations, WYDOT's quick response helped retain access, especially on US 14 where multiple slides occurred. A new slide near the Antelope Butte Ski Area required an emergency repair contract, and mitigation on the Little Tongue River slide west of Ranchester was let to contract to prevent anticipated road damage that threatened access to the Bighorn National Forest and Bighorn Basin. A new, particularly large, slide cropped up on US 14 in Shell Canyon that WYDOT stabilized before the snowmelt and spring rains wreaked further havoc.\n\nAs part of WYDOT's prevention efforts, during winter weather in a remote mountain canyon, about 300 feet above the roadway, Geology, District 5, and a drilling contractor removed and replaced a pump for a high capacity dewatering well. The old well was installed in 1970 and constantly pumped 400,000 gallons of water per day until failing in 2022. Replacing the pump was critical to avoid landslide hazards.\n\nWhether stabilizing landslides, scaling canyon walls, plowing snow, or preparing for future hazards, WYDOT crews work together to help you get where you need to go come rain, wind, or snow.\n\nMitigation efforts on the Little Tongue River Slide\n\nPAGE 21\n",

Systems Planning applied for multiple grants including one for I-80 fracture critical bridge replacements and another for the Cheyenne College Drive grade separation. The Management Services Program wrote and submitted successful grant applications ranging from interchange design to truck parking and wildlife crossing projects. Notably, WYDOT received a $24.3 million Wildlife Crossing Pilot Program (WCPP) award making it the largest single WCPP grant award in the country. These applications are a team effort across multiple programs.\n\n### HIGH MAST LIGHT TOWERS\nHigh mast light tower failure is a nationwide problem, and WYDOT's research in this area has resulted in national design standards. In 2023, the Bridge Program completed wind tunnel testing and design for new towers and, with the Traffic Program, installed a test tower at Dwyer Junction rest area. As a result, WYDOT began replacing all high mast towers in the state.\n\n### WEIGHT RESTRICTED CLOSURES\nIn response to an increasing number of blow-over crashes, WYDOT piloted a new alert system to prevent blow-overs and provide more information to travelers during high wind events.

WYDOT now posts road closures for vehicles under certain gross vehicle weights (based on wind conditions) using dynamic messaging signs and ports of entry to better define vulnerable vehicles while keeping roads open for vehicles unlikely to blow over. Working closely with ITS and WHP, PAO also launched an information campaign to educate the public on the new system. The next phase will create a pre-event system to show expected wind closures by weight and recommend windows of opportunity for drivers to proceed.\n\nCasper Marginal work (**top to bottom**) demolition, girder placement, deck pour, retaining wall\n\n# CASPER MARGINAL\n\nHighway Development and District 2 let the Casper Marginal project for $57.7 million in 2023. For this multi-faceted project, teams designed horizontal and vertical alignments, cross-sectional elements, and other critical components while coordinating with ROW, property owners, and regulatory agencies to strategically facilitate right-of-way acquisitions. These impressive design efforts resulted in an equally impressive construction project, which includes the following aspects:\n**I-25 Reconstruction**: replaces all I-25 structures over the North Platte River.\n**F Street Realignment**: realigns and reconstructs a portion of F Street.\n**Storm Drain System**: installs an updated storm drain system, complete with a Stormceptor filtration unit, to effectively manage storm water runoff while protecting the North Platte River.\n**Ramp Refinement**: widens ramps to 24 feet for safer, easier movement on and off the highway.\n**Retaining Walls**: constructs retaining walls at strategic locations to overcome clearance and right-of-way challenges while providing stability and aesthetic appeal.\n**Bike Path Connection**: crafts a bike path to integrate the F Street bridge and pedestrian path with the existing route under the structure, which involved careful alignment to promote safe and convenient biking.\n\nThese improvements will substantially enhance safety, efficiency, and the overall travel experience along this crucial corridor in one of Wyoming's most densely populated areas.\n\nPAGE 24",

Surveying consultant fees totaled about **$330,000**, and a new master service agreement consultant was selected for District 4. The program managed **1,849 permitted outdoor advertising structures**, processed **2 new permits**, and revoked **71 permits**. ROW managed the Junkyard Control Program, regulating **51 junk and salvage yards**.\n\n**TRAFFIC** advanced the Cody tunnel lighting upgrade, and the ELECTRICAL DESIGN SECTION completed **13 projects** representing **$8.2 million in electrical work**.\n\n**GEOLOGY** provided **construction support on nine different projects**, including pile driving monitoring, landslide repair, drilled shaft inspection, tie back anchor inspection, and rock scaling inspection. The program assisted with an emergency rock scaling project in the Wind River Canyon and with Bridge Program highway tunnel inspections. The program completed **297 test holes** and **7,087 feet of drilling and digging** for subsurface investigations. The Geotechnical Foundation Lab **tested 692 soil** and **46 geotextile samples**.\n\n**DISTRICT 1** prioritized safety with an annual safety summit and a comprehensive safety training calendar. MAINTENANCE assisted in the Agile Chariot Air Force exercise, which successfully landed a C-130, two A-10 fighter jets, an MQ-9 Reaper, and two MH-6M Little Bird helicopters on US 287 north of Rawlins. TRAFFIC reviewed access permits, traffic impact studies, pedestrian safety, and more. Working with MAINTENANCE, TRAFFIC updated all Adopt-a-Highway signs districtwide. EQUIPMENT crews in Cheyenne and Rawlins received new LaRue T-80 rotary plow units.\n\n**DISTRICT 2** focused on safety, recruiting, and training with great success—a 20 percent decreased vacancy rate. With the new recruits, MAINTENANCE worked in inclement weather to keep roads clear while maintaining fences, pipes, bridges, guardrails, and facilities. TRAFFIC ensured signing and electrical systems remained functional while EQUIPMENT received a new LaRue truck-mounted snow blower, which is 50 percent larger than the 40 year-old unit it replaced.\n\n**District 3** emphasized safety and training while trying to recruit to combat staffing shortages. MAINTENANCE continued working with the US Forest Service on managing highway use, recreational use, and local interests in the Teton Pass area. TRAFFIC reviewed and approved access permits and striped thousands of miles of highway. EQUIPMENT performed maintenance and inspections on hundreds of pieces of equipment, including preventative maintenance.\n\nPAGE 25\n",

The department supports multimodal transportation, administers driver's licenses and other services, and provides internal services that keep the agency's wheels turning to better serve the public.\n\n# BEYOND ROADS AND BRIDGES\n\nWYDOT supports local governments, communities, and other transportation stewards to enable a robust, multimodal transportation system. From managing pass-through funding for local pathway projects and transit providers, to supporting freight rail service, WYDOT ensures people and products stay connected and keep moving.\n\n# MULTI-USE PATHWAY\n\nThe Local Government Coordination office awards pass-through federal funding to cities, towns, and counties through the Transportation Alternatives Program, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, and HRRR. To ensure pedestrian safety, connectivity, and equity, the Civil Rights Program, along with other WYDOT programs, contracted with Street Smart in 2023 to compile data on Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) facilities on the pedestrian circulation path within WYDOT's rights-of-way as it relates to curb ramps, sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals.\n\nWY has over 45 transit providers, including intercity bus providers, serving 1.347M trips in FY23.\n\n# TRANSIT\n\nMost Wyoming transit providers are extremely small yet provide vital mobility and connectivity for often older, disabled, or low-income persons. Notably, a growing number of folks outside of traditional transit riders are beginning to use these services. For all current and potential users, WYDOT works with dedicated providers to leverage federal funding for the best possible service despite challenging rural conditions. In FY23, more fixed route trips (916,893 trips) were taken versus on-demand service trips (430,515 trips). Both fixed-route and on-demand services were used the most for personal purposes, though other popular transit uses included fixed-route service to access education and on-demand service to commute home.\n\nWY has 5 railroad carriers and over 1,700 route miles\n\n# FREIGHT RAIL\n\nAlthough WYDOT cannot own or operate rail, it does work with railroad companies to ensure rail and communities coexist safely while supporting the economy. To this end, the ROW Program completed\n\nPAGE 26\n",

WYDOT provides limited air service to state officials as well as supports Wyoming airports and air service. In 2023, the Flight Operations Program provided on-demand air service to 21 state agencies, commissions, public boards, and elected officials. The program flew 592 flight segments and transported 2,011 passengers. Compared to FY22, FY23 saw a 2 percent increase in flight hours and passengers.\n\nTo support airport improvements in FY23, Aviation Planning Program administered $5.1 million in state funds and $60.1 million in federal pass-through funds. WYDOT facilitated airport improvement grants for 155 projects at 35 airports including major projects in Casper, Cheyenne, Cody, Douglas, Jackson, Riverton, and others. These projects served a variety of purposes, including safety, maintenance, security, enhancement, and planning. Aviation Planning also allocated an additional $2.1 million in state funds from the Wyoming Aeronautics Commission's statewide line item programs, which include crack seal, aviation encouragement, marketing and promotions, and navigational aid maintenance.\n\n# OFF THE ROADS AND IN THE OFFICE\n\nWYDOT's top priority is serving its customers, whether ensuring safe travel to important destinations or administering specialty plates so Wyomingites can ride in style. WYDOT helps its customers on and off the road. Perhaps the most direct interaction between WYDOT and the public is through non-infrastructure services, such as driver's licenses, specialty plates, state-assigned vehicle identification numbers (VINs), and similar services. Less obvious forms of customer service occur when WYDOT works with transportation stakeholders, such as businesses, local public agencies, and the Wyoming Legislature. For instance, though it may not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking customer service, the Utilities Section provides one-on-one support to companies that use the utilities online permitting software.\n\nAs of December 2023, WY has 454,385 licensed drivers, and of those, 34,701 hold a CDL/CLP. About 13,000 drivers renewed their license through the mail.\n\nWith over 25 Driver Services exam stations spread statewide for customer convenience, the Driver Services Program is on the front lines of WYDOT's customer service presence, completing about 199,000 customer transactions in FY23. These services included:\n*   » Issuing driver's licenses and identification cards (IDs)\n*   » Providing driving records\n*   » Issuing disabled placards\n*   » Collecting reinstatement fees\n*   » Other transactions\n\nBeyond normal customer service operations, Driver Services also worked with Wyoming's Military Affairs Department to streamline the process for honorably discharged veterans to add the VETERAN designation to their Wyoming license or ID.\n\nAnother common touch point for customers, the Motor Vehicle Services (MVS) Program completed title searches and issued state assigned VINs, generating over $39,000 in revenue while bringing in an additional $644,590 from issuing dealership and rental licenses. Perhaps the most frequent customer service MVS provides is managing Wyoming's popular specialty license plates. In 2023, MVS collected $188,248 for specialty plates. In accordance with state statute, MVS's Plate Production team also began producing and delivering the new 2025 license plates, producing 231,338 in 2023.\n\nPAGE 27\n",

MAINTENANCE responded to the Cootie slide, the Junior slide in the Wind River Canyon, several smaller landslides, and erosion events in Fremont County. Crews also **chip sealed more than 47 miles**. TRAFFIC rebuilt the complex paint and bead delivery systems on the striping trucks, upgraded Adopt-A-Highway signs, and completed annual inspections on all **48 traffic signal systems**.\n\n**PLANNING** created plans to meet IIJA requirements, including the Wyoming Statewide Freight Improvement Plan, Carbon Reduction Plan, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan, and the Risk and Resilience Plan. SYSTEMS PLANNING secured hydrogen alternative fuels corridor designations for interstate routes and submitted the particulate matter (PM) 2 and PM3 biennial performance measure results and targets to FHWA, receiving approval to exempt all projects within the Upper Green River non-attainment area from conformance review. ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES provided environmental review and compliance guidance for multiple projects working with other programs and district staff. The section **prepared National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents for 90 projects** and provided project management for the combined WY 22 and Tribal Trails project in Teton County as well as the US 30 road relocation. The section installed game cameras to monitor the nine wildlife crossing structures at the recently completed Dry Piney wildlife crossings. Cultural staff processed five historical bridge mitigations and completed multiple cultural reviews.\n\nPAGE 28\n",

This project will replace the current system, referred to as RIS, that has been used since 1986. The modernized system is referred to as the Transportation Information System (TIS).\n\nFY23 saw existing work continue on the modernization while new work began. After a request for proposal (RFP)—managed by the Procurement Services Program—Kyndrl was selected to begin the modernization process. Driver Services started its part, which focuses on correcting existing deficiencies and adding new capabilities to increase efficiencies and enhance customer service. The new system will provide customers with an online portal offering a 360-degree view of their existing information in the system. Further, this online portal will provide new tools that will allow customers to complete certain services, receive answers to questions, and better understand Driver Services' processes.\n\nSome modernization processes were already underway and continued in 2023 before the contract to Kyndrl was awarded. A key component of preparing for TIS was preparing data, and the IT Program was vital in collaborating with MathTech during this process. MVS also spent countless hours describing data and data processes to MathTech to help inform the RFP regarding the title registration part of TIS. Additionally, the Compliance and Investigation Program continued to offer insights based on the new system's impact on compliance. TIS completion is slated for 2025.\n\n# HELPING US HELP YOU\nSometimes the most overlooked services are the internal services that help outward facing programs better serve our customers. Without these internal services, WYDOT could not meet its mission.\n\n# THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB\nMultiple WYDOT programs help obtain and maintain tools, equipment, software, and more used to get the job done efficiently and effectively. WYDOT must follow certain procurement requirements to ensure a fair process for interested bidders and companies. The Procurement Services Program serves on the front lines of ensuring WYDOT forces have the proper equipment and systems for optimal operations. In 2023, Procurement Services facilitated three notable RFPs that had a significant impact on improving WYDOT operations:\n*   Track Type Asphalt Paving Machine: This new machine was needed for paving operations in the Thermopolis area. Honnen Equipment Company was awarded the contract for $566,942.00.\n*   TIS Transition: As noted before, the RIS modernization will provide new and exciting capabilities\n\nPAGE 29\n",

Intelligent Imaging System was awarded the contract for $1.283 million.\n\nThe Equipment Program and district equipment crews are also crucial for purchasing, maintaining, and repairing equipment vital to WYDOT operations, including the following important purchases in 2023:\n\n» 54 WHP vehicles\n» 27 tandem axle truck chassis for snow truck builds\n» 1 track-type asphalt paver\n» 3 loader-mounted rotary snow blowers\n» 2 tow plows\n» 21, four-wheel drive mowing tractors\n» 2, four-wheel mechanical street sweepers\n» 3 skid steers with attachments\n» 1 all-wheel drive motor grader with wing and v-plow\n» 1 articulated all-wheel drive, four-yard front end loader\n» 1, 84-inch tandem vibratory roller\n\nCaring for internal assets is pivotal for maintaining infrastructure assets, so in 2023, district equipment crews performed inspections, preventative maintenance, repairs, and more to reduce equipment down time and ensure readiness. For instance, in District 4, crews completed more than 1,700 preventative maintenance inspections and services for the district's 878 pieces of equipment. In District 2, a 40-year old truck-mounted snow blower was finally replaced with a significantly larger unit to improve snow removal operations.\n\nBeyond standard equipment—like plows, sanders, bush mowers, pavers, and more—WYDOT crews also rely on innovative, specialty equipment, such as drones. The Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Program works with WYDOT crews to develop innovative ways to deploy drones (or UAS) to enhance efficiencies and effectiveness. In 2023, UAS worked extensively with a WYDOT task force (formed in 2020) to further integrate drone use in program operations by identifying deployment opportunities with the greatest benefit.\n\nIn the office, specialty equipment is also used to boost productivity and efficiency, such as the Mailing Services Section's new inserter, which replaced its old inserter that had processed over 100,000 documents. The new inserter enabled staff to fold and insert 188,530 documents in 2023 alone.\n\nDistrict 4 new LaRue rotary snow plow gets to work opening US 14A.\n\nPAGE 30\n",

FY23 saw essentially every WYDOT employee engage in a WYDOT-delivered learning opportunity—completing 4,560 employee development opportunities. Employees continued to prefer online learning, which accounted for 82 percent of training completions.\n\nIn a significant step towards growing agency leadership, the Training Services Program, in collaboration with other WYDOT programs, established a new WY Advancing Leaders Academy (WY Leads) in 2023. The first cohort included 15 employees who represented a cross-section of WYDOT. Participants applied and were selected by existing WYDOT leadership. The sessions, including presentations from various WYDOT programs. WY Leads also included mentorship from executive staff and capstone projects presented to executive staff. To further enrich the experience, a roundtable discussion—captured on video by PAO—featured state agency leaders across Wyoming for a wider look at leadership beyond WYDOT. After completing the academy, participants provided valuable feedback to improve the experience for future cohorts.\n\nWYDOT employees also gained valuable knowledge and skills from other learning opportunities, such as WYDOT University classes and WY Supervise: New Supervisor's Program. Employees continued to rate WYDOT University classes highly, reporting improved behaviors and learning gains.\n\nBeyond learning facilitated by Training Services, other programs provided training to fellow WYDOT personnel. For instance, Environmental Services provided environmental/NEPA training for two districts and Project Design staff. Civil Rights trained new supervisors and new hires on Title VI non-discrimination, and Maintenance trainers also provided equipment training and commercial driver's license (CDL) testing for WYDOT personnel. Notably, the Maintenance Program established an internal CDL Training Program to better prepare WYDOT personnel to pass CDL testing required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). Equipment technician training was also prevalent across WYDOT to ensure crews safely and effectively handle equipment. Training topics included hydraulic diagnostics, welding, electric systems diagnostic, machining/lathe, Detroit engine/after treatment systems, Vogele paver, Larue snow blower, and vehicle lift safety. Additionally, the WHP Safety and Training Section submitted 575 training courses to the Wyoming Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission (POST) for accreditation and processed hundreds of individual training requests for the professional advancement for our agency personnel.\n\n## FY23 EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT\n\n|                        | FY19  | FY20  | FY21   | FY22  | FY23  |\n| ---------------------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- |\n| NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS | 840   | 1,116 | 1,685  | 1,808 | 1,851 |\n| TOTAL COMPLETIONS      | 6,098 | 7,255 | 10,610 | 5,370 | 4,560 |\n\n\nPAGE 31\n",

This outreach helps WYDOT establish and maintain strategic partnerships that help us serve our customers' needs better and achieve our mission.\n\n# PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT\n\nWYDOT uses both routine public communications and specialized information releases to keep the public and stakeholders informed. Between a dedicated Public Affairs Office (PAO) and district public information specialists, WYDOT reaches an expansive audience when informing the public or requesting input. PAO communicates routinely through various mediums and publications to maximize outreach. The Office Services Program prints and distributes these publications, including the following jobs produced in 2023:\n\n*   Interchange (36,646 copies)\n*   Wyoming Road Work Guide (13,200 copies)\n*   Official State Highway Map\n*   Highway Safety calendar (925 copies)\n*   Highway Safety advertising campaigns\n*   Posters\n*   Information graphics\n*   Brochures\n\nBeyond the printed word, PAO uses video news releases (releasing 52 weekly WYDOT Reports in 2023) and maintains an online presence with 5,870 YouTube subscribers and 60,000 Facebook subscribers. WYDOT's main Facebook page reached 2.2 million people in 2023, not including analytics from the district Facebook pages.\n\nFor specialized information releases in 2023—regarding projects, alerts, and more—Office Services sent out 6,839 postcards for District 1 alerting local residents of detours for the Curtis Street bridge demolition and produced 1,000 Construction and General OSHA books, 239 STIP books, 158 Materials Lab testing manuals, printed plans and proposals for 66 awarded bid letting jobs, and 50 state budget book copies for all Wyoming state agencies.\n\nCurtis Street Bridge deck pour\n\nPAGE 33\n",

The truck parking ribbon cutting even featured an in-person speech by FHWA Administrator Shailen Bhatt, an appearance PAO helped coordinate.\n\nProviding information to the public is not just a job for public information specialists either, multiple programs engage with the public, answer questions, and provide information to maintain transparency. For instance, the Maintenance Program fields many public information requests, and ROW completed 350 public and internal research requests in 2023. In the districts, public meetings and STIP meetings allow folks to talk with subject matter experts, inquire and comment about projects, and learn about construction impacts, traffic control, and project benefits.\n\n# STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND PARTNERSHIPS\n\nWYDOT works with a range of stakeholders and partners at the local, state, and federal levels. Engagement may take the form of education and training, joint initiatives, or policy changes—all for the benefit of Wyoming's transportation system and services.\n\n# LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS\n\nIn the districts, WYDOT partners with multiple agencies and local governments to accomplish local projects through cooperative agreements on WYDOT projects. WYDOT's Management Services Program also seeks local support from impacted cities, counties, non-government organizations, and others when pursuing discretionary grants. Ensuring local businesses, industry, and governments support WYDOT projects is integral to project success and meeting local needs. WYDOT also turns to communities for help. In 2023, work continued to secure necessary agreements for WYDOT to tie into the Teton County School District's sewage system for the proposed Jackson Housing Project. This housing project would provide more affordable housing for WYDOT employees to ensure WYDOT can meet regional transportation needs. Obtaining the necessary agreements is an important first step before WYDOT's architectural consultant can complete the construction plans for the proposed housing facility.\n\nLocal stakeholder engagement also takes the form of education and training. The Compliance and Investigation Program is a perfect example of WYDOT's commitment to outward education. In 2023, Compliance and Investigation provided onsite joint training for county clerks,\n\nDistrict 5 snow plow naming contest\n\nPAGE 34\n",

Compliance and Investigation staff created a comprehensive training manual to anchor sessions with topics including relevant state statutes, rules and regulations, and various documents used to sell, finance, and title vehicles after sale or transfer. In a testament to this training's effectiveness, Compliance and Investigation received a nearly 100 percent satisfaction rating. Another example of engagement through education was the grant presentation the Management Services Program gave during the first annual Federal Funding Summit. The presentation reached a wide audience of representatives from local governments, non-profits, industry, and more. Management Services, Highway Safety, and the Grants and Contracts programs also connected with many community and business leaders about specific projects and challenges statewide during the summit. Ensuring WYDOT is a reliable source of information related to transportation continues to be paramount for WYDOT's relationship building.\n\nPublic and advisory committee meetings for the planning of improvements for WY 22 between Jackson and Wilson.\n\n# GOVERNMENT RELATIONS\nWYDOT's government relations take many forms, from monthly commission meetings to policy discussions with Wyoming's Congressional delegation.\n\n## Commissions\nWYDOT works with three commissions—each with Governor-appointed representatives from around Wyoming. WYDOT engages with each commission at least monthly to provide education and seek input on activities. A key piece of WYDOT's relationship and communication with the commissions depends on two dedicated commission secretaries.\n\nThe Aeronautics Division works closely with the Aeronautics Commission to administer airport improvement projects, approve Wyoming airport grants, encourage use of Wyoming airports, and support fly-ins and air shows. As part of its WyoLink stewardship, the Emergency Communications Commission (PSCC) to recommend improvement strategies for Wyoming's wireless interoperability, determine WyoLink network standards, identify and create technological and policy solutions to develop WyoLink, and recommend legislation or other state action to advance wireless interoperability in Wyoming. Finally, WYDOT's entire executive staff works with the Transportation Commission to fulfill the department's duties. The Transportation Commission awards contracts for improvements undertaken with State Highway Fund monies, adopts WYDOT's rules and regulations, and oversees broad transportation policy emphasis areas.\n\nPAGE 35\n",

        "text": "\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\n# Agencies\n\nWYDOT partners with state and federal agencies to ensure Wyoming's transportation system meets the needs of all who rely on it. In 2023, the Maintenance Program partnered with other state agencies on environmental, wildlife, natural disaster, and emergency management issues to coordinate swift responses and solutions and minimize traveler impacts. Maintenance also worked with other state agencies to control noxious weeds in WYDOT rights of way and plant living snow fences to improve safety during winter months. Additionally, the Environmental Services Section coordinated with both federal and state agencies—such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD), Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, and others—to address environmental concerns and obtain permits. Environmental Services successfully coordinated the FHWA programmatic agreement update regarding the processing of actions classified as categorical exclusions for federal-aid highway projects as well as a new programmatic agreement with the State Historic Preservation Office. Agency partnerships like these help tackle larger projects as well. For example, Environmental Services coordinated with district staff and WGFD to evaluate wildlife crossing features for the upcoming Halleck Ridge and US 189 wildlife crossings.\n\n## Elected Officials\n\nWYDOT stays engaged with elected officials to educate policy makers on issues, solutions, and opportunities regarding the state's transportation system. As part of state legislative activities in 2023, Management Services worked with programs and executives to create educational interim materials, analyze legislation for WYDOT impacts, and track bills throughout the session. One of the more notable legislative issues that WYDOT worked during the interim was updating statutory requirements for color photos on Wyoming driver's licenses and IDs to improve quality and security credentials. The Driver Services Program provided key testimony to the Joint Transportation Committee, which resulted in successful legislation. Driver Services began issuing the new, more secure, credentials in November 2023. Management Services also kept in consistent contact with the Governor's office and Congressional staff to inform them about WYDOT policy stances and IIJA implementation challenges and opportunities, including Build America/Buy America, discretionary grant rural exceptions, and truck parking. These efforts resulted in impactful policy changes at the federal level that improve WYDOT operations.\n\n# INDUSTRY AND OTHER NON-GOVERNMENT ENTITIES\n\nWYDOT relies heavily on its relationships with industry partners and non-government stakeholders. The Construction Program's work with the Wyoming Associated General Contractors (Wyoming AGC) is a great example of how WYDOT forges industry relationships to improve our transportation system. Construction held joint 2023 WYDOT/AGC meetings to cover topics such as cover structures, drilled shafts, and construction collaboration that address industry and agency priorities. Significantly, 2023 saw WYDOT and AGC develop and conduct the first round of construction collaboration training for field and contractor personnel. This milestone helped move the collaboration training to full implementation on all projects. The Civil Rights Program also collaborated with the Wyoming AGC to train and educate their members on the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program. Additionally, WYDOT partners with higher education as demonstrated in Environmental Services' partnership with the University of Montana to begin wildlife monitoring assessment for the second phase of the Jackson South project.\n\nWYDOT is also an active participant with the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Representatives from the Highway Development Program are active on AASHTO's Technical Committee on Roadside Safety, and in 2023 personnel authored Chapter 9, Semi-rigid Barriers, of the revised Roadside Design Guide. The Management Services team also represents WYDOT on AASHTO's Transportation Policy Forum, providing a rural perspective to national transportation policy issues.\n\nPAGE 36\n",

WYDOT's Internal Review Services Program is integral to auditing WYDOT resources and operations. For instance, Internal Review Services reviews consultant services costs to determine if rates are reasonable for WYDOT projects, completing 29 such reviews in FY23. Internal Review Services also uses a risk-based approach to evaluate pass-through funds to subrecipients and reviews compliance audits for any findings related to WYDOT funds—ultimately issuing a management decision per 2 CFR 200. Perhaps most notably, Internal Review Services performs a cash funds audit to ensure the appropriate use of WYDOT funds according to policy. For the FY22 Single Audit, WYDOT received an unmodified opinion and zero findings for federal awards.\n\nWYDOT programs have passed many audits with no findings. In FY23, the Financial Services Program received an unmodified audit opinion on its financial statements, and MVS received no findings from an IFTA peer review audit on IFTA licensing and tax return reporting. When auditing WYDOT operations, findings show WYDOT's efficiencies and effectiveness. In FY23, Internal Review Services reviewed traffic striping rates, for example, with the results clearly demonstrating the effectiveness and quality of WYDOT performance in this area.\n\n# RESEARCH\n\nWYDOT participates in research initiatives to further innovate and advance WYDOT operations. A vital piece of WYDOT's research efforts stem from the Research Advisory Committee (RAC), which distributed about $1.6 million to seven research projects in 2023. The RAC prioritizes projects on how they address issues affecting operations of WYDOT, stakeholders, and Wyoming highways as well as how they will advance techniques, materials, or specifications from a financial, operational, environmental, or social viewpoint. WYDOT's Research Center also provides financial support for WYDOT's participation in several national organizations, including the Transportation Research Board (TRB), Product Evaluation and Audit Solutions Program, and National Cooperative Highway Research Program. On a local level, the Research Center distributes funds to the Local Transportation Assistance Program, which the University of Wyoming administers.\n\nNotable research work in 2023 included the Materials Program's participation in the FHWA Midwest States Balanced Mix Design Peer Exchange. Balanced mix design incorporates performance testing into the mix design process to predict multiple distress modes occurring because of mix aging, traffic, climate, and location within the pavement structure. The balanced mix design implementation will\n\nPAGE 38\n",

Additionally, the Highway Development Program oversaw research to develop approach guardrail transitions for both MGS and box beam guardrail to the new bridge rail and a box beam transition to various concrete barrier shapes. Texas A&M performed this research and is trying to obtain FHWA eligibility letters to deploy the new transitions. Highway Development also solicited a proposal from the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility in Lincoln, Nebraska, to develop median barrier hardware for box beam guardrail, which was selected by the RAC for funding. These ongoing research efforts and collaborations will keep WYDOT ready for the future of transportation safety and performance.\n\nDistrict 5 pavement work in Buffalo Valley\nImage: A road construction scene with heavy machinery and a dump truck on a highway.\n\n# EFFICIENCIES BY DIVISION\n\nThough this entire report provides many examples of WYDOT's efficiencies, the following lists additional accomplishments in FY23 regarding innovation and efficiency benefitting Wyoming.\n\n## Aeronautics\n*   Air Service Development saw the CPA deliver more passengers through Wyoming airports while reducing the cost per passenger.\n*   Engineering and Construction administered $3.87 million in group pavement maintenance projects resulting in about $810,000 in cost savings from economies of scale.\n*   Flight Operations operated and maintained its own hangar facility, located at the Cheyenne Regional Airport, including a fuel farm that enables the program to buy fuel at wholesale cost, saving $133,000 in fuel expenses.\n*   Flight Operations' pilots work with Air Traffic Control to fly the most efficient and direct flight routes for additional cost savings.\n\n## Engineering and Planning\n*   Bridge finalized a simple span bridge design using pre-stressed, pre-cast slab sections that are post-tensioned transversely to accelerate bridge construction and reduce traffic disruptions.\n*   C&E continued working with a developer to improve web-based bidding software, reducing the time to produce reports while increasing accuracy.\n*   Program Performance implemented monthly updates to all changes made to projects, and reassigned projects to project managers to bolster efficiency.\n\nPAGE 39\n",

The program assisted other agencies with vehicle-related issues, responded to complaints from vehicle industry victims, and investigated VIN and title fraud. Notably, program personnel investigated several cases of online fraud scams where perpetrators convincingly represented themselves as currently licensed dealers and offered vehicles for sale online, then required monetary deposits to be sent to fictitious locations or bank accounts, with no intention of delivering any vehicle.\n\n**MANAGEMENT SERVICES** coordinated with surrounding states to advance rural state policy priorities and respond to federal comment periods regarding Build America/Buy America waiver extensions, greenhouse gas emissions, and other IIJA implementation topics. The program represented WYDOT on the Statewide Nuclear Working Group and AASHTO's TPF. The program published six internal policies and worked on several rule promulgations, including the Wildlife Conservation Plates and Driver's Licenses rules.\n\n**INTERNAL REVIEW** provided critical information to decision makers to mitigate risk and ensure compliance and maintain good stewardship of resources. The program reviewed consultant services costs to determine if the rate is reasonable for WYDOT projects as a way to manage resources.\n\n**CIVIL RIGHTS** provided policy development and guidance on Title VI, Prevailing Wage, ADA, internal and external Equal Employment Opportunity requirements, the DBE Program, and the Federal Contractor Compliance Program. Total DBE participation for this reporting year was **5.29 percent** with **two new DBEs certified**. The program also posted all of the pertinent federal-aid posters on the WYDOT website to help the contracting industry. Website updates and information concerning poster updates has been reiterated at subsequent meetings with contractors.\n\nPAGE 41\n",

It is integral to our quality of life, to our ability to earn a living, to our broader economy, and to our connections with the rest of the world. Our transportation system is crucial to moving people and goods safely and efficiently. In Wyoming, because of our transportation system and the distances we have to travel, our citizens and businesses are among the most mobile in the nation.\n\nEfficient transportation is vital for economic development, especially for Wyoming's top three industries—energy, tourism, and agriculture. This is no less true for our growing manufacturing and technology sectors. Roads, bridges, and air service are fundamental to a business-ready, business-friendly environment.\n\nGovernor Mark Gordon\n\nEvery day, in all kinds of weather, Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT) employees undertake diverse activities to maintain and improve the state's vast transportation network. Now more than ever, when so much is changing, their work is more complicated and the challenges more varied.\n\nMany of WYDOT's duties center on taking care of the 6,700-mile state-owned highway system—including more than 900 miles of interstate. WYDOT personnel—in partnership with the private sector—plan, design, construct, and maintain highways, bridges, and roadsides; coordinate with federal and state agencies to manage traffic; promote safety; plow snow in often adverse conditions; build and maintain rest areas; and provide many other important services. And they do all these duties while prioritizing the wellbeing of travelers on our roads and the wildlife we all love.\n\nWYDOT's mission involves other critical services as well: Wyoming Highway Patrol troopers and other personnel enforce motor vehicle laws, investigate motor vehicle crashes, issue oversize and overweight permits, and collect commercial motor carrier fees. Other agency employees issue and monitor driver's licenses and vehicle registrations and provide fuel tax administration. Aeronautics personnel oversee the state's Airport Improvement Program for public-use airports and work to improve air service. WYDOT employees also work with Wyoming communities to provide local transportation planning, transit, bicycle and pedestrian pathways, and other services. To accomplish all this, Department personnel use a variety of in-person and virtual outreach mechanisms to listen to Wyoming's citizens and identify their needs and preferences for transportation.\n\nI am proud of the Wyoming Department of Transportation as it strives to maintain the state's highway and airport networks, which connect us with each other, the nation, and the world. Please take a moment to review the annual report that follows. It summarizes the past year, examines WYDOT's challenges, and celebrates the accomplishments of WYDOT's committed employees. Travel safely and enjoy our roads and airports.\n\nWYDOT 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 4\n",

For the FY 2021 Single Audit, WYDOT received an unmodified opinion and zero findings for federal awards.\n\nCommendably, IR also achieved a 'pass' rating from a peer review of the program's processes and procedures.\n\n# Management Services\n\nThe program participated in American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials activities—notably, the Transportation Policy Forum and the Discretionary Grant Working Group. The team also coordinated with surrounding states to advance rural state policy priorities including Build America Buy America waiver extensions, National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) rules, and the Federal Highway Administration stewardship and oversight agreement.\n\nThe team worked directly with Congressional staff on Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act implementation while also supporting state legislative activities.\n\nThe team, with help from DISTRICT 5 and PUBLIC AFFAIRS, arranged the Beartooth Ravine Bridge ribbon cutting ceremony. Additionally, MANAGEMENT SERVICES collaborated with HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT, the districts, and other internal programs to prepare, edit, and submit grant applications and reports, including applications for the I-25/I-80 interchange design ($18.5 million request) and US 20 passing lanes from Thermopolis to Shoshoni and Shoshoni towards Waltman ($11.4 million request).\n\nStakeholders at the Beartooth ribbon cutting planned and hosted by WYDOT.\n\nWYDOT 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 5",

The county trainings addressed the following: temporary registration permits; dealer/manufacturer license plates; factory price-base MSRP; vehicle types and identification; vehicle titles; significant forms used by dealers, clerks, and treasurers in vehicle transactions; and titling and registration. The program also educated attendees on relevant laws and rules and regulations.\n\nCOMPLIANCE continued to assist in the Revenue Information System/Transportation Information System (RIS/TIS) modernization project, helped other agencies with vehicle-related issues, responded to complaints from vehicle industry victims, and investigated Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and title fraud.\n\n# REGULATED VEHICLE-RELATED INDUSTRIES\n\nCOMPLIANCE AND INVESTIGATION regulates and ensures compliance for the following businesses:\n* Vehicle Dealers\n* Salvage Yards\n* Towing Companies\n* Wyoming-based Commercial Trucking Companies\n* Rental Vehicle Agencies\n* Ignition Interlock Device Service Centers\n\n# DRIVER SERVICES\n\nDRIVER SERVICES completed approximately 209,000 transactions covering driver's license and identification card issuance, driving records, disabled placards, reinstatement fee collections, and other transactions. The program also processed and entered about 35,000 citations for in-state drivers and 20,000 for out-of-state drivers.\n\nLeading up to and continuing through the February 7, 2022, compliance date for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Entry-Level Driver Training final rule, DRIVER SERVICES worked with PUBLIC AFFAIRS to launch an education campaign on the coming changes. DRIVER SERVICES saw a significant increase in commercial learner's permit (CLP) applicants leading up to the compliance date—issuing 1,500 CLPs between November and February compared to about 445 CLPs during the same period the previous year. The general knowledge tests required for all CLPs also saw a notable uptick—in December 2021, DRIVER SERVICES administered 689 knowledge tests compared to 1,232 tests in January 2022. In the week leading up to the compliance date, the program processed 800 knowledge tests.\n\nDRIVER SERVICES worked with WYDOT's INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) team on several projects to streamline processes. In early 2023, the program expects to launch an update on its website to alleviate long waits at exam stations by allowing customers to sign up virtually in select locations and \"get in line\" without going to the exam station. Clients will then receive a text message or email when DRIVER SERVICES is ready to process their request. Also, the IT team helped develop an Ignition Interlock Management System that creates more efficient ignition interlock vendor oversight and client monitoring.\n\n# DRIVER'S LICENSE STATISTICS\n\n* As of December 31, 2022, there were 447,575 licensed drivers.\n* Of the licensed drivers, 34,701 hold a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) and/or CLP.\n* About 12,500 drivers renewed their driver's license through the mail in 2022.\n\nWYDOT 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 18\n",

With travel rebounding from the height of the pandemic, the CPA continued to work largely as intended—delivering more passengers through Wyoming airports while reducing the cost per passenger.\n\nNotably, the second, three-year term of the CPA was successfully negotiated.\n\n# ENGINEERING & CONSTRUCTION\n\nThe program continued work on the statewide Geographic Information System (GIS) based airport pavement management program as well as maintenance on the state network of mountain weather stations.\n\nPersonnel oversaw 40 design, construction, and equipment acquisition projects; 20 navigational aid maintenance projects; 16 aviation encouragement projects; and 9 marketing projects.\n\nThe program administered $3.22 million in group pavement maintenance projects resulting in an estimated $1.5 million in cost savings from economies of scale.\n\nAdditionally, the program conducted safety data inspections at 11 Wyoming airports.\n\n# FLIGHT OPERATIONS\n\nThe program provided on-demand air service to 21 state agencies, commissions, public boards, and elected officials with two aircraft, six pilots, and three support staff.\n\nTravel rebounded, particularly the last half of FY 2022, as hours and passengers flown returned to near pre-pandemic numbers. Overall, FY 2022 showed a 220 percent increase in hours flown and a 225 percent increase in number of passengers flown from FY 2021. However, when compared to the three-year pre-pandemic average, passengers carried saw a 16 percent decrease and hours flown saw a 15 percent decrease.\n\nThe program operated and maintained its own hangar facility located at the Cheyenne Regional Airport, including a fuel farm enabling the program to buy fuel at wholesale cost—saving $160,000 in fuel expenses.\n\nThe program's pilots worked with Air Traffic Control to plan and fly efficient flight profiles, netting an additional $52,600 in savings in FY 2022.\n\n| FLIGHT OPERATIONS BY THE NUMBERS | FLIGHT OPERATIONS BY THE NUMBERS |\n| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| 632                              | Flight Segments Flown            |\n| 85%                              | of Flights Flown In State        |\n| 1,968                            | Passengers Transported           |\n| 398                              | Flight Hours Flown               |\n| 134,900                          | Miles Covered                    |\n\n\n# AVIATION PLANNING & PROGRAMMING\n\nOn behalf of the Wyoming Aeronautics Commission, the program administered the Wyoming Aviation Capital Improvement Plan (WACIP) along with the grant and loan program funding.\n\nThe division administered $10.4 million in state funds and $49 million in federal pass-through funds for airport improvements.
