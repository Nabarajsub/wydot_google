It is integral to our quality of life, to our ability to earn a living, to our broader economy, and to our connections with the rest of the world. Our transportation system is crucial to moving people and goods safely and efficiently. In Wyoming, because of our transportation system and the distances we have to travel, our citizens and businesses are among the most mobile in the nation.\n\nEfficient transportation is vital for economic development, especially for Wyoming's top three industries—energy, tourism, and agriculture. This is no less true for our growing manufacturing and technology sectors. Roads, bridges, and air service are fundamental to a business-ready, business-friendly environment.\n\nEvery day, in all kinds of weather, Wyoming Department of Transportation (WYDOT) employees undertake diverse activities to maintain and improve the state's vast transportation network. Now more than ever, when so much is changing, their work is more complicated and the challenges more varied.\n\nMany of WYDOT's duties center on taking care of the 6,700-mile state-owned highway system—including more than 900 miles of interstate. WYDOT personnel—in partnership with the private sector—plan, design, construct, and maintain highways, bridges, and roadsides; coordinate with federal and state agencies to manage traffic; promote safety; plow snow in often adverse conditions; build and maintain rest areas; and provide many other important services. And they do all these duties while prioritizing the wellbeing of travelers on our roads and the wildlife we all love.\n\nWYDOT's mission involves other critical services as well: Wyoming Highway Patrol troopers and other personnel enforce motor vehicle laws, investigate motor vehicle crashes, issue oversize and overweight permits, and collect commercial motor carrier fees. Other agency employees issue and monitor driver's licenses and vehicle registrations and provide fuel tax administration. Aeronautics personnel oversee the state's Airport Improvement Program for public-use airports and work to improve air service. WYDOT employees also work with Wyoming communities to provide local transportation planning, transit, bicycle and pedestrian pathways, and other services. To accomplish all this, Department personnel use a variety of in-person and virtual outreach mechanisms to listen to Wyoming's citizens and identify their needs and preferences for transportation.\n\nI am proud of the Wyoming Department of Transportation as it strives to maintain the state's highway and airport networks, which connect us with each other, the nation, and the world. Please take a moment to review the annual report that follows. It summarizes the past year, examines WYDOT's challenges, and celebrates the accomplishments of WYDOT's committed employees. Travel safely and enjoy our roads and airports.\n\n*Governor Mark Gordon*\n\nWYDOT 2022 ANNUAL REPORT    4\n",

Additionally, IR analyzed striping rates and reviewed AERONAUTICS participating percentages for accuracy and reasonableness.\n\n### SINGLE AUDITS\n\n*IR gathers information for WYDOT's annual 2 CFR 200 Single Audit to ensure agency eligibility to recieve federal funds, including pass-through funding to local communities for important transportation improvements.*\n\nIR issued five management decisions for pass-through entities addressing compliance with Title 2 Code of Federal Regulations Part 200 (2 CFR 200). For the FY 2021 Single Audit, WYDOT received an unmodified opinion and zero findings for federal awards.\n\nCommendably, IR also achieved a 'pass' rating from a peer review of the program's processes and procedures.\n\n## MANAGEMENT SERVICES\n\nThe program participated in American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials activities—notably, the Transportation Policy Forum and the Discretionary Grant Working Group. The team also coordinated with surrounding states to advance rural state policy priorities including Build America Buy America waiver extensions, National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) rules, and the Federal Highway Administration stewardship and oversight agreement.\n\nThe team worked directly with Congressional staff on Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act implementation while also supporting state legislative activities.\n\nThe team, with help from DISTRICT 5 and PUBLIC AFFAIRS, arranged the Beartooth Ravine Bridge ribbon cutting ceremony. Additionally, MANAGEMENT SERVICES collaborated with HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT, the districts, and other internal programs to prepare, edit, and submit grant applications and reports, including applications for the I-25/I-80 interchange design ($18.5 million request) and US 20 passing lanes from Thermopolis to Shoshoni and Shoshoni towards Waltman ($11.4 million request).\n\n*Stakeholders at the Beartooth ribbon cutting planned and hosted by WYDOT.*\n\nWYDOT 2022 ANNUAL REPORT                                                                        5\n",

The new arrangement significantly reduces design and construction efforts by using welded wire reinforcing mats instead of individual reinforcing steel bars.\n\nBRIDGE started preliminary engineering for 44 off-system (local agency) and more than 60 on-system (state-owned) bridge replacements, leveraging $225 million in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds.\n\nAdditionally, the program worked on standard bridge replacement alternatives using precast elements and ultra-high performance concrete. Using accelerated bridge construction techniques, the new design minimizes construction time and traffic disruption.\n\n### BRIDGE WORK & INSPECTIONS\n\n- *6 Replacements*\n- *103 Rehabilitations*\n- *2 Box Culverts*\n- *1 Retaining Wall*\n- *3 Miscellaneous Structures*\n- *14 Initial Inspections*\n- *26 Elemental Update Inspections*\n- *31 Fracture Critical Inspections*\n- *16 Overhead Sign Inspections*\n- *52 High Mast Light Tower Inspections*\n- *7 Bridge Damage Inspections*\n\n## CONTRACTS AND ESTIMATES (C&E)\n\nC&E oversaw 89 awarded highway contracts (73 federally funded and 16 state funded), with many including combined projects, totaling $370 million in construction costs.\n\nOf those awarded, 67 contracts went to in-state bidders and 22 went to out-of-state bidders. The average number of bidders per project was 2.5—lower than the previous year—with one first time bidder to WYDOT projects.\n\nDespite several factors driving up construction costs—inflation, instability in material markets, and suboptimal bidder turnout—C&E kept the aggregate Engineer's Estimate within 5 percent of total construction cost.\n\nC&E worked with its software developer to improve the web-based bidding software and increase efficiency through automated reports and processes.\n\nC&E also enhanced communication, speed, and project delivery while reducing addenda.\n\n## GEOLOGY\n\nTo monitor landslide movements statewide, GEOLOGY oversaw the installation of 17 new slope inclinometers; the program monitors 108 slope inclinometers total.\n\n*BRIDGE completed wind tunnel testing and design for the new high mast light towers. High mast light tower failure is a national issue, and WYDOT's valuable research resulted in important updates to national design standards.*\n\nWYDOT 2022 ANNUAL REPORT7\n",

The total anticipated gas tax receipts from these two sources is roughly $168 million.\n\n2.  **Chart 2: FY 2023 ANTICIPATED DIESEL TAX TOTAL**\n    *   **Description:** This is a pie chart showing how the anticipated total diesel tax for fiscal year 2023 is distributed among various entities.\n    *   **Data:** The chart is segmented into five portions:\n        *   **State Highway Fund:** Receives the largest share at $59,087,512.\n        *   **Counties:** Receive the second largest share at $15,756,669.\n        *   **L.U.S.T. (Local Urban System Trust/Fund):** Receives $6,131,312.\n        *   **Cities:** Receive $3,939,168.\n        *   **Administration:** Receives the smallest portion at $900,777.\n    *   **Trends/Observations:** The State Highway Fund is the primary recipient of diesel tax revenue, receiving a dominant share (well over half of the total). Counties receive a significant, but much smaller, secondary portion, followed by L.U.S.T. and Cities. The administrative portion is comparatively very small.\n\n3.  **Chart 3: FY 2023 ANTICIPATED GAS TAX TOTAL**\n    *   **Description:** This is a pie chart detailing the distribution of the anticipated total gas tax for fiscal year 2023 among different funds and entities.\n    *   **Data:** The chart is divided into eight segments:\n        *   **State Highway Fund:** Receives the largest portion at $43,635,745.\n        *   **Cities:** Receive $11,383,217.\n        *   **County Road Fund:** Receives $10,624,337.\n        *   **Counties:** Receive $10,244,895.\n        *   **L.U.S.T.:** Receives $3,407,678.\n        *   **State Parks Off-Road Vehicles:** Receive $1,045,037.\n        *   **State Parks Snowmobiles:** Receive $963,256.\n        *   **State Parks Motor Boats:** Receive $891,008.\n    *   **Trends/Observations:** The State Highway Fund receives the largest share of the gas tax, similar to the diesel tax distribution, though it appears to be a smaller percentage of the total compared to its share in diesel tax. Cities, County Road Fund, and Counties receive substantial and relatively similar portions. L.U.S.T. receives a smaller but still significant amount. State Parks programs for Off-Road Vehicles, Snowmobiles, and Motor Boats each receive relatively small, comparable amounts",

Additionally, the program provided onsite joint training for vehicle dealers and county officials in each county.\n\nPersonnel created a comprehensive manual to assist attendees during training and in the future.\n\nThe program achieved an impressive 98 percent overall satisfaction rating from these training sessions. The county trainings addressed\n\n### REGULATED VEHICLE-RELATED INDUSTRIES\n\n*Compliance and Investigation regulates and ensures compliance for the following businesses:*\n\n- *Vehicle Dealers*\n- *Salvage Yards*\n- *Towing Companies*\n- *Wyoming-based Commercial Trucking Companies*\n- *Rental Vehicle Agencies*\n- *Ignition Interlock Device Service Centers*\n\nthe following: temporary registration permits; dealer/manufacturer license plates; factory price-base MSRP; vehicle types and identification; vehicle titles; significant forms used by dealers, clerks, and treasurers in vehicle transactions; and titling and registration. The program also educated attendees on relevant laws and rules and regulations.\n\nCOMPLIANCE continued to assist in the Revenue Information System/Transportation Information System (RIS/TIS) modernization project, helped other agencies with vehicle-related issues, responded to complaints from vehicle industry victims, and investigated Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and title fraud.\n\n## DRIVER SERVICES\n\nDRIVER SERVICES completed approximately 209,000 transactions covering driver's license and identification card issuance, driving records, disabled placards, reinstatement fee collections, and other transactions. The program also processed and entered about 35,000 citations for in-state drivers and 20,000 for out-of-state drivers.\n\nLeading up to and continuing through the February 7, 2022, compliance date for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Entry-Level Driver Training final rule, DRIVER SERVICES worked with PUBLIC AFFAIRS to launch an education campaign on the coming changes. DRIVER SERVICES saw a significant increase in commercial learner's permit (CLP) applicants leading up to the compliance date—issuing 1,500 CLPs between November and February compared to about 445 CLPs during the same period the previous year. The general knowledge tests required for all CLPs also saw a notable uptick—in December 2021, DRIVER SERVICES administered 689 knowledge tests compared to 1,232 tests in January 2022. In the week leading up to the compliance date, the program processed 800 knowledge tests.\n\nDRIVER SERVICES worked with WYDOT's INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) team on several projects to streamline processes. In early 2023, the program expects to launch an update on its website to alleviate long waits at exam stations\n\n### DRIVER'S LICENSE STATISTICS\n\n*As of December 31, 2022, there were 447,575 licensed drivers.*\n\n*Of the licensed drivers, 34,701 hold a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) and/or CLP.*\n\n*About 12,500 drivers renewed their driver's license through the mail in 2022.*\n\nby allowing customers to sign up virtually in select locations and \"get in line\" without going to the exam station. Clients will then receive a text message or email when DRIVER SERVICES is ready to process their request. Also, the IT team helped develop an Ignition Interlock Management System that creates more efficient ignition interlock vendor oversight and client monitoring.\n\nWYDOT 2022 ANNUAL REPORT    18\n",

The vertical axis represents counts, ranging from 0 to 12,000.\n\nThere are two categories of data presented for each fiscal year, indicated by different colored bars:\n1.  **Light red/pink bars:** Represent \"Number of Participating Employees (Unique).\"\n2.  **Dark red/maroon bars:** Represent \"Total Completions.\"\n\nHere are the specific data points for each fiscal year:\n\n*   **FY 2019:**\n    *   Number of Participating Employees (Unique): 840\n    *   Total Completions: 6,182\n*   **FY 2020:**\n    *   Number of Participating Employees (Unique): 1,116\n    *   Total Completions: 7,397\n*   **FY 2021:**\n    *   Number of Participating Employees (Unique): 1,685\n    *   Total Completions: 10,610\n*   **FY 2022:**\n    *   Number of Participating Employees (Unique): 1,808\n    *   Total Completions: 5,370\n\n**Trends and Observations:**\n\n*   **Number of Participating Employees (Unique):** This metric shows a consistent upward trend across the years. It started at 840 in FY 2019, increased to 1,116 in FY 2020, then to 1,685 in FY 2021, and reached its highest point at 1,808 in FY 2022.\n*   **Total Completions:** This metric saw a significant increase from FY 2019 to FY 2021, rising from 6,182 to 7,397, and then peaking at 10,610. However, in FY 2022, there was a sharp decline to 5,370, which is lower than the completion numbers in FY 2019 and FY 2020.\n*   **Relationship between the two metrics:** In all years, the \"Total Completions\" (dark red bars) are substantially higher than the \"Number of Participating Employees (Unique)\" (light red bars), indicating that each unique employee likely accounts for multiple completions. The most notable trend is the dramatic decrease in \"Total Completions\" in FY 2022, despite the \"Number of Participating Employees (Unique)\" continuing to rise in that same year",

With travel rebounding from the height of the pandemic, the CPA continued to work largely as intended—delivering more passengers through Wyoming airports while reducing the cost per passenger.\n\nNotably, the second, three-year term of the CPA was successfully negotiated.\n\n## ENGINEERING & CONSTRUCTION\n\nThe program continued work on the statewide Geographic Information System (GIS) based airport pavement management program as well as maintenance on the state network of mountain weather stations.\n\nPersonnel oversaw 40 design, construction, and equipment acquisition projects; 20 navigational aid maintenance projects; 16 aviation encouragement projects; and 9 marketing projects.\n\nThe program administered $3.22 million in group pavement maintenance projects resulting in an estimated $1.5 million in cost savings from economies of scale.\n\nAdditionally, the program conducted safety data inspections at 11 Wyoming airports.\n\n## FLIGHT OPERATIONS\n\nThe program provided on-demand air service to 21 state agencies, commissions, public boards, and elected officials with two aircraft, six pilots, and three support staff.\n\n### FLIGHT OPERATIONS BY THE NUMBERS\n\n- *632 Flight Segments Flown*\n- *85% of Flights Flown In State*\n- *1,968 Passengers Transported*\n- *398 Flight Hours Flown*\n- *134,900 Miles Covered*\n\nTravel rebounded, particularly the last half of FY 2022, as hours and passengers flown returned to near pre-pandemic numbers. Overall, FY 2022 showed a 220 percent increase in hours flown and a 225 percent increase in number of passengers flown from FY 2021. However, when compared to the three-year pre-pandemic average, passengers carried saw a 16 percent decrease and hours flown saw a 15 percent decrease.\n\nThe program operated and maintained its own hangar facility located at the Cheyenne Regional Airport, including a fuel farm enabling the program to buy fuel at wholesale cost—saving $160,000 in fuel expenses.\n\nThe program's pilots worked with Air Traffic Control to plan and fly efficient flight profiles, netting an additional $52,600 in savings in FY 2022.\n\n## AVIATION PLANNING & PROGRAMMING\n\nOn behalf of the Wyoming Aeronautics Commission, the program administered the Wyoming Aviation Capital Improvement Plan (WACIP) along with the grant and loan program funding.\n\nThe division administered $10.4 million in state funds and $49 million in federal pass-through funds for airport improvements. Airport improvement grants for 159 projects were provided to 34 different airports, including major projects in Cheyenne, Douglas, Evanston, Lander, and Rock Springs.\n\nAn additional $1.9 million in state funds was allocated for the Aeronautics Commission's statewide line item\n\nWYDOT 2022 ANNUAL REPORT                                                                         24\n",

These are significant maps that display geographical data.\n\nHere is a detailed description of the maps for a blind user:\n\nThe page displays two distinct maps of Wyoming, each illustrating the state divided into counties and then grouped into numbered districts for different commissions. Both maps are bordered in black, show the individual county lines, and highlight Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park in light green in the northwest region of the state.\n\n**1. Aeronautics Commission District Map (Top Map)**\nThis map shows the state of Wyoming's counties organized into five districts for the Aeronautics Commission. Each district is outlined with a thick orange-red line and contains a white box with a black border, holding a black district number.\n\n*   **District 1:** Located in the southeast corner of Wyoming, this district includes the counties of Laramie, Albany, Platte, and Goshen. The number '1' is placed within Laramie County.\n*   **District 2:** Situated in the south-central part of the state, this district covers Sweetwater and Carbon counties. The number '2' is placed within Sweetwater County.\n*   **District 3:** Positioned in the west-central and central parts of Wyoming, this district encompasses Fremont, Natrona, Hot Springs, and Washakie counties. The number '3' is placed within Natrona County.\n*   **District 4:** Covering the entire northeast quadrant of the state, this large district includes Sheridan, Johnson, Campbell, Crook, Weston, and Niobrara counties. The number '4' is placed within Campbell County.\n*   **District 5:** Located in the northwest, this district comprises Park, Big Horn, and Teton counties. The number '5' is placed within Big Horn County.\n*   **Unnumbered Counties:** The counties of Sublette, Lincoln, and Uinta, located in the western and southwest parts of the state, are not included in any of the five numbered districts as depicted by the red outlines.\n\n**2. Transportation Commission District Map (Bottom Map)**\nThis map shows the state of Wyoming's counties organized into seven districts for the Transportation Commission. Similar to the first map, each district is outlined with a thick orange-red line and contains a white box with a black border, holding a black district number. In this map, all counties in Wyoming are assigned to a numbered district.\n\n*   **District 1:** In the southeast, this district includes Laramie, Platte, and Goshen counties. The number '1' is placed within Goshen County.\n*   **District 2:** In the south, this district covers Sweetwater, Carbon, and Uinta counties. The number '2' is placed within Sweetwater County.\n*   **District 3:** In the western part of the state, this district encompasses Sublette, Lincoln, and Teton counties. The number '3' is placed within Sublette County.\n*   **District 4:** In the north-central and northeast, this district includes Sheridan, Johnson, and Campbell counties. The number '4' is placed within Johnson County.\n*   **District 5:** In the northwest, this district covers Park, Big Horn, and Hot Springs counties. The number '5' is placed within Park County.\n*   **District 6:** In the far eastern part of the state, this district includes Crook, Weston, and Niobrara counties. The number '6' is placed within Weston County.\n*   **District 7:** Centrally located, this district comprises Fremont, Natrona, and Washakie counties. The number '7' is placed within Natrona County.\n\nIn summary, both maps illustrate the administrative divisions of Wyoming's counties into districts, but they show different groupings and numbers of districts depending on the specific commission (Aeronautics vs. Transportation). The Aeronautics map shows five districts and leaves three counties unassigned, while the Transportation map shows seven districts covering all counties",

This report serves as a comprehensive overview of WYDOT's tireless endeavors, achievements, and ongoing role in shaping Wyoming's transportation.\n\nThroughout Wyoming's vast and diverse landscapes, our state transportation infrastructure is the backbone connecting us all. WYDOT's diligent efforts to maintain and improve our transportation system touch every corner of the state. That reach is so integral to Wyoming's operations that it is difficult to depict in a snapshot of numbers. For roads alone that's a 6,700-mile state-owned highway system—including more than 900 miles of interstate.\n\nWYDOT's mission is not just to build roads and bridges; it is to forge pathways that connect our communities, drive economic growth, and ensure the safety of every Wyomingite and traveler. This report delves into WYDOT's core responsibilities, illustrating the meticulous maintenance of our highway network, relentless pursuit of road safety, support of our rural airports, and strategic initiatives aimed at fostering economic development. You will find insights into how WYDOT is leveraging emerging technologies, adapting to new challenges, and preparing for the future.\n\nEach employee contributes to successfully implementing WYDOT's mission. I extend my appreciation to each of you for your work and daily dedication. It is essential to acknowledge the collaborative spirit that underpins WYDOT's success. WYDOT works hand in hand with local communities, businesses, and stakeholders, embodying the Wyoming spirit of self-reliance and cooperation. A few major successes WYDOT achieved in 2023 stand out to me:\n\n» Implemented a new weight-based closure system to improve safety and reduce collisions while keeping roads open and goods moving.\n\n» Received three competitive federal grants, including $26.6 million to build 365 truck parking spaces along I-80 in Evanston; $24.3 million to complete a wildlife crossing project south of Kemmerer; and $13 million to complete design for the new I-80/I-25 interchange.\n\n» Opened a new virtual lobby for Driver Services making waiting for your license more convenient.\n\n» Welcomed 10 new troopers to Wyoming highways—the guardians of the Cowboy State.\n\nI was also glad to appoint Darin Westby as WYDOT's director. He is a strategic leader who is guiding WYDOT's evolution to meet today's demands, plan for the future, and work with our stakeholders to better Wyoming.\n\nAs we reflect on the accomplishments and continue our pursuit of the challenges documented in these pages, let us take pride in WYDOT's pivotal role in shaping the infrastructure that binds us together. May this annual report inspire confidence in our shared journey toward a brighter, more connected future for the great state of Wyoming.\n\nMark Gordon  \nGovernor of Wyoming\n\nPAGE 3\n",

        "text": "\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\n# DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE\n\n*Director Darin Westby, PE*\n\nReflecting on my first year as WYDOT director, I am impressed by our employees and their dedication. Our mission is vital, yet despite everyone's daily reliance on a functioning transportation system, I have been surprised by how easily it is taken for granted. My hope is to draw attention to how integral our transportation system is and how it connects everything from Wyoming's top industries—energy, tourism, and agriculture—to daily destinations like work, school, and medical facilities.\n\nWYDOT serves all who travel Wyoming no matter how they get around, whether by car, truck, bike, bus, or plane. Our priority is ensuring everyone arrives safely, which is why our Strategic Highway Safety Plan now accounts for vulnerable road users. We also care about non-traditional road users, such as mule deer and pronghorn, which is why we work with our passionate state partners on tackling wildlife crossing projects. And our work has paid off—the recently completed Dry Piney wildlife crossings are showing promising results with cameras capturing hundreds of animals using the passages. WYDOT also received the largest award from the national 2023 Wildlife Crossing Pilot Program for wildlife crossing infrastructure along US 189 to accomodate new energy development in southwest Wyoming.\n\nWyoming's transportation system is complex and so is caring for it. No matter the weather, WYDOT keeps our infrastructure in the best possible condition. Whether plowing roads, applying millions of gallons of striping paint, or repairing guardrails and clearing right of ways, WYDOT is a proud steward of our infrastructure. Our teams strategically select and design projects that maximize safety and effectiveness given limited stateside funding and inflation. A notable project in 2023 was the Casper Marginal, which is a historically large project for WYDOT and will provide safer, more efficient traffic flow in one of Wyoming's most densely populated areas. I continue to be impressed with how WYDOT accomplishes such important projects despite increased workloads and staffing shortages.\n\nBeyond normal construction and maintenance duties, WYDOT innovates to meet challenges. In 2023, WYDOT's ingenuity took on the wind. Engineering teams finalized and tested a design for a new high mast light tower to ensure the new design withstands Wyoming's winds. Meanwhile, WYDOT began piloting the first phases of a high wind road closure system based on gross vehicle weight limits to better inform travelers and reduce blow-over crashes. WYDOT also educated the Wyoming Legislature on this issue, which resulted in legislation to increase the fines for those who violate high-wind closures.\n\nAnother notable aspect of WYDOT that often goes overlooked is our reach beyond roads and bridges. WYDOT is the steward of the statewide public safety interoperable radio communications system, WyoLink, as well as home to Wyoming Highway Patrol and Aeronautics. WYDOT also houses many transportation-related services, from administering driver's licenses to specialty plates. And perhaps the most unsung heroes are those WYDOT programs that serve the agency internally to ensure customer-facing services are as effective as possible.\n\nAs I continue to learn more about WYDOT, I want to keep educating others on our brand, especially the importance and impact of our mission and how we meet it every day. I also want to ensure transparency, both inside and outside the agency. Continuing to educate stakeholders and the public will help us obtain and maintain strategic partnerships and accomplish even more.\n\nI look forward to what new challenges and opportunities await our agency, and hope this annual report serves as a reminder of all WYDOT does for this great state.\n\nPAGE 4\n",

WYDOT uses its funding for the stewardship of Wyoming's transportation system and for providing transportation-related services.\n\n## FEDERAL VS. STATE FUNDING\n\nGiven Wyoming's small population and large swathes of federal land, WYDOT receives relatively more federal transportation funding per capita than most other states; however, federal dollars must be matched with non-federal dollars. WYDOT uses state funding as non-federal match to leverage federal dollars as well as provide other transportation services. In fiscal year (FY)2023, WYDOT received $433.8 million of Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funds, resulting in 84 projects let to construction.\n\n### FEDERAL VS. STATE HIGHWAY FUNDING COMPARISON\n\n| **STATE HWY<br/>FUNDS<br/>NATIONAL<br/>AVERAGE<br/>69%**   | **STATE HWY<br/>FUNDS WY<br/>AVERAGE<br/>27%**   |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| **FEDERAL HWY<br/>FUNDS<br/>NATIONAL<br/>AVERAGE<br/>31%** | **FEDERAL HWY<br/>FUNDS WY<br/>AVERAGE<br/>73%** |\n\n\n## REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES\n\nState funding from state fuel taxes, registrations, vehicle fees, and driver's licenses are used to match federal funds and provide funding for non-highway needs. WYDOT currently uses much of its overall resources (federal and state combined) for highway improvement, maintenance, and operations, but funds are also invested in aeronautics, Wyoming Highway Patrol (WHP), emergency communications, planning, and other transportation-related services.\n\n### FUEL TAX RECEIPTS AND REVENUE DISTRIBUTION\n\nWYDOT receives fuel tax receipts at both the federal and state levels. At $0.184 (gasoline) and $0.244 (diesel) the federal fuel tax rate has not changed since 1993, and money raised from these taxes is fed into the Federal Highway Trust Fund and\n\ndistributed to states. WYDOT receives more revenue from federal fuel taxes than it provides. At the state level, WYDOT's fuel tax was last increased ($0.10) in 2013, and currently sits at $0.24 for both gasoline and diesel.\n\n**WY has 1,264 IRP carriers (8,433 truck/3,375 trailer plates issued) and 1,264 IFTA carriers (8,581 IFTA decal sets issued).**\n\nThrough the International Registration Plan (IRP) and International\n\nPAGE 7\n",

STATE HIGHWAY FUNDING COMPARISON\". This chart visually represents percentages of highway funding from state and federal sources, comparing national averages with Wyoming's averages. It consists of two vertical, rectangular bar-like graphics placed side-by-side. Each graphic is divided into two segments, representing the proportion of state versus federal funds, adding up to 100%.\n\n**Left Graphic: National Average Highway Funding**\n*   **State Highway Funds (National Average):** This segment occupies the top 69% of the bar and is labeled \"STATE HWY FUNDS NATIONAL AVERAGE 69%\". It is displayed in a light green color.\n*   **Federal Highway Funds (National Average):** This segment occupies the bottom 31% of the bar and is labeled \"FEDERAL HWY FUNDS NATIONAL AVERAGE 31%\". It is displayed in an orange-brown color.\n    *   **Trend:** Nationally, state highway funds are a significantly larger source of funding (69%) compared to federal highway funds (31%).\n\n**Right Graphic: Wyoming Average Highway Funding**\n*   **State Highway Funds (Wyoming Average):** This segment occupies the top 27% of the bar and is labeled \"STATE HWY FUNDS WY AVERAGE 27%\". It is displayed in a light green color.\n*   **Federal Highway Funds (Wyoming Average):** This segment occupies the bottom 73% of the bar and is labeled \"FEDERAL HWY FUNDS WY AVERAGE 73%\". It is displayed in an orange-brown color.\n    *   **Trend:** In Wyoming, federal highway funds are a significantly larger source of funding (73%) compared to state highway funds (27%).\n\n**Overall Comparison and Trends:**\nThe chart highlights a stark contrast between national and Wyoming's highway funding structures. Nationally, state funds are the dominant source, contributing more than twice as much as federal funds. Conversely, in Wyoming, federal funds are the dominant source, contributing nearly three times as much as state funds. This indicates that Wyoming is substantially more reliant on federal funding for its highways compared to the national average",

The chart is divided into eleven segments, representing different categories of expenditure.\n\n*   The largest portion by far is **Highway Improvement**, accounting for $494,617,502, which is approximately 56.5% of the total expenditures. This segment is significantly larger than any other.\n*   The second largest category is **Maintenance/Operations**, at $118,937,428, representing about 13.6% of the total.\n*   Next are **Aeronautics** with $64,010,292 (approximately 7.3%) and **Law Enforcement** with $61,213,262 (approximately 7.0%). These two categories are of similar size.\n*   **Other Expenditures** total $27,752,649 (about 3.2%).\n*   **Planning/Administration** accounts for $26,124,142 (about 3.0%).\n*   **Capital Expenditures** are $24,465,833 (about 2.8%).\n*   **Support Services** total $23,189,059 (about 2.6%).\n*   **WYOLink** expenditures are $21,802,039 (about 2.5%).\n*   **Operating Transfers Out** are $10,564,790 (about 1.2%).\n*   The smallest category is **Administration**, at $2,063,696 (approximately 0.2%).\n\nIn summary, over half of the FY23 actual expenditures were dedicated to Highway Improvement, with Maintenance/Operations being the next most significant category.\n\n**Chart 2: FY24 ANTICIPATED FUEL TAX COLLECTIONS BY SOURCE**\nThis is a horizontal stacked bar chart showing the anticipated fuel tax collections for Fiscal Year 2024, broken down by the recipient source and by fuel type (Gasoline vs. Diesel). The Y-axis lists the collection sources, and the X-axis represents dollar amounts ranging from $0 to $70,000,000. Each bar represents a collection source, and its length corresponds to the total anticipated collection for that source. The bars are colored green for Gasoline contributions and orange for Diesel contributions.\n\nA legend at the bottom indicates overall anticipated collections of $82.569 million from Gasoline and $87.350 million from Diesel. However, it's worth noting that the sum of the explicitly labeled Diesel portions across the bars totals approximately $93.9 million, exceeding the legend's stated Diesel total. The sum of the explicitly labeled Gasoline portions totals approximately $65.3 million.\n\nHere's a breakdown by source, from top to bottom:\n\n*   **Motor Boats:** Anticipate $814,839, entirely from Gasoline (green bar).\n*   **Snowmobiles:** Anticipate $939,175, entirely from Gasoline (green bar).\n*   **ORV (Off-Road Vehicle):** Anticipate $1,031,357, entirely from Gasoline (green bar).\n*   **County Road Fund:** Anticipates a total of $10,697,357. The bar is visually split into green (Gasoline) and orange (Diesel) segments, but the specific amounts for each fuel type are not labeled for this category.\n*   **Fuel Tax Admin.:** Anticipates $918,225, entirely from Gasoline (green bar).\n*   **Cities:** Anticipate a total of $15,476,901, with $4,015,470 from Gasoline (green) and $11,461,431 from Diesel (orange). Diesel collections are significantly higher for cities.\n*   **Counties:** Anticipate a total of $26,377,199, with $10,315,319 from Gasoline (green) and $16,061,880 from Diesel (orange). Diesel collections are also notably higher for counties.\n*   **L.U.S.T. (Leaking Unground Storage Trust):** Anticipate a total of $9,496,680, with $3,373,896 from Gasoline (green) and $6,122,784 from Diesel (orange). Diesel contributes more than Gasoline.\n*   **State Highway Fund:** Anticipates the largest collection by far, totaling $104,167,667. This comprises $43,935,616 from Gasoline (green) and $60,232,051 from Diesel (orange). Diesel collections represent the largest single contribution to this fund and are substantially higher than Gasoline contributions.\n\nOverall, the State Highway Fund is projected to receive the vast majority of fuel tax collections. For most categories that collect from both fuel types, Diesel contributions are higher than Gasoline contributions, often significantly so. Smaller categories like Motor Boats, Snowmobiles, ORV, and Fuel Tax Administration collect relatively minor amounts, primarily or entirely from Gasoline",

WYDOT also provides tools for our customers to plan safe, informed travel; and, if the worst should happen, WYDOT facilitates fast and effective response.\n\n## SAFETY STARTS WITH US\n\nLeading by example, WYDOT is constantly improving safety practices. In 2023, the Employee Safety Program implemented new and improved training based on workforce safety needs, including (in coordination with WHP) an active shooter training to hundreds of state employees. Employee Safety also developed new training for 2024, covering confined spaces, fall protection, trenching and excavation, and Narcan ®.\n\nEmployee Safety and district safety representatives (DSRs) pursue safety certifications to ensure they provide the best guidance to WYDOT employees. To this end, in 2023 WYDOT's safety team received the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Certified Safety and Health Official certification.\n\nIn addition to formal training, the districts, including their DSRs, complete shop and safety meetings to keep mechanics abreast of workplace changes and safety programs. These safety meetings include job safety analysis and other protocols to advance a safe working environment.\n\n## SAFETY DRIVES US\n\nFrom planning and design to maintenance and data collection, WYDOT keeps safety in mind. Improving safety starts with a plan, so in 2023 the Highway Safety Program updated the Strategic Highway Safety Plan to include vulnerable road users (bicyclists and pedestrians) for a more inclusive safety strategy.\n\n*WYDOT employees congregating for excavation and trenching training*\n\nPAGE 11\n",

To improve data analysis and provide public access to crash data, Highway Safety updated the Safety Portal in 2023 and provided data to safety partners. Additionally, Highway Safety and WHP also submitted timely, accurate crash reports.\n\nEvery WYDOT project shares the goal of creating a safer transportation system; however, safe travelers are the ultimate safety tool. To help promote positive safety behaviors, WYDOT provides\n\n## TOTAL FATALITIES BY YEAR (2018-2022)\n\n| Year | Fatalities |\n|------|------------|\n| 2018 | 111 |\n| 2019 | 147 |\n| 2020 | 127 |\n| 2021 | 110 |\n| 2022 | 134 |\n\nfunds through the Highway Safety Behavior Grant Program. In FY23, about $4.7 million of these behavioral safety grants were awarded for new projects—focusing on vulnerable road users, impaired driving, occupant protection, and roadside injury prevention. The awarded projects will be ready to implement next year. To further support safer drivers, WYDOT trains safer travelers, such as defensive driving courses provided by WHP. In 2023, WHP instructed 90 defensive driving classes with 797 students attending. Troopers also taught 172 safety presentations to schools, businesses, fairs, and other safety events. WYDOT also provides more focused training; for instance, the Motorcycle Safety Program trained 950 students, both new and existing riders, over 90 classes at eight locations statewide in 2023. To help travelers plan safer trips, WYDOT also provides many travel tools.\n\n## TRAVEL TOOLS\n\nWith quickly changing road conditions through most Wyoming seasons, WYDOT provides a variety of tools to help travelers stay informed and make a safe travel plan.\n\nDuring the winter, the Wyoming Travel Authorization Program (W-TAP) served 18,500 citizens, ensuring travelers reached their destinations safely with more than 15,000 W-TAP subscribers.

Notably, the Geographical Information System (GIS)/Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Program developed a new process for weight-based high-wind closures to promising results (to read more about this exciting project, see **Project Highlights**). To further enhance safety communications with road users, WYDOT's GIS/ITS team deployed connected vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) devices at about 75 locations along I-80 in 2023 as WYDOT continues to be a national leader in the C-V2X space.\n\n## EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nAlthough everyone prefers to avoid safety incidents, crashes still occur. As part of WYDOT's holistic safety approach, the department facilitates fast and efficient emergency response to minimize harm.\n\nThrough WyoLink—Wyoming's statewide, public safety interoperable radio communications system—WYDOT provides a vital communication tool for emergency responders and public safety and service agencies statewide. The system is interoperable, meaning that agencies can directly communicate with each other in larger scale events and operations. In FY23, WYDOT oversaw awards totaling $4.5 million in ARPA funds to local agencies to purchase new WyoLink equipment. Expansion continues for interoperable communications across adjacent state and cellular networks with WYDOT obtaining two FirstNet compact rapid deployable through a partnership with FirstNet to address coverage gaps and improve service.\n\nTo further enhance emergency communications, the Information Technology (IT) Program expanded use of the Cradlepoint IBR1700 trunk modems for WHP, which allow wireless connectivity to office infrastructure when a vehicle is within range of building WiFi. This connectivity supports higher speeds for offloading trooper video and WiFi connectivity for radios as a backup communication system for WyoLink. IT also implemented connectivity using the StarLink satellite system alongside cellular in the WHP command bus.\n\nIn another notable accomplishment for improved emergency response, after coordinating with other state and local entities, the Next Generation 911 (NG 911) GIS completed the Wyoming NG 911 GIS Data Model, which will further NG911 in the state.\n\n## ENFORCEMENT\n\nWHP's tireless efforts in enforcing Wyoming's laws on our roadways is a key piece to WYDOT's safety approach. WHP enhances public safety by patrolling Wyoming's highways, enforcing highway safety and state statutes, and performing criminal interdiction.\n\nIn 2023, WHP responded to 4,527 crashes and arrested 1,357 impaired drivers. Additionally, WHP stopped 58,958 vehicles and issued 42,892 citations for speeding, 1,260 for driving while license suspended, 328 for no child restraint, and 1,712 for no seatbelt. Troopers also issued 43,130 warnings for traffic violations and faulty equipment. WHP contacted 770,590 commercial vehicles weighing 324,701 and finding 39,551 to be overweight. Consequently, WHP issued 182,896 oversize/overweight permits collecting $10.543 million in fees. To enhance commercial vehicle safety, WHP inspected 12,627 commercial vehicles finding 7,708 out-of-service violations.\n\nCitizens also contributed to safer enforcement on our roads by contacting the Dispatch Center to report drunk driving and other suspicious behaviors. As a result, the Dispatch Center fielded 136,366 calls, including 2,931 Report Every Drunk Driver Immediately Reports, 1,316 Safe2Tell (anonymous tip reporting system) tips, and 6,060 calls for towing services.",

WYDOT uses asset management to maximize benefits with limited funding.\n\n## SYSTEM OVERVIEW\n\nWyoming's transportation system is vast and complex serving multimodal transportation—including roads, bridges, air travel, transit, pathway, and freight rail. Such an expansive system requires many different stewards, from WYDOT to cities, counties, transit providers, private industry, and more. WYDOT collaborates with other transportation stakeholders, including the public, to ensure a safe, efficient, and connected statewide transportation system.\n\n## ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\nFederal law requires WYDOT to develop and implement a risk-based Transportation Asset Management Plan to establish and track performance targets for infrastructure assets. As a result of WYDOT's relatively flat stateside funding, which limits the amount of federal dollars that can be leveraged, the department currently focuses on asset preservation rather than enhancements and expansion.\n\n| **WYOMING FEDERAL-AID SYSTEM OVERVIEW** |                                            |\n| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| 30,247<br/>TOTAL PUBLIC ROAD MILES      |                                            |\n| 7,970<br/>WY FEDERAL-AID SYSTEM MILES   |                                            |\n| 3,975<br/>FEDERAL-AID NHS MILES         | 3,995<br/>OTHER FEDERAL-AID<br/>ROAD MILES |\n| 3,062<br/>NON-INTERSTATE<br/>NHS MILES  | 913<br/>INTERSTATE MILES                   |\n\n\nWYDOT uses asset management to guide project selection.

This chart uses a hierarchical, box-based structure to present a breakdown of road mileage in Wyoming.\n\nHere's a detailed description of the chart data:\n\n1.  **Total Public Road Miles:** At the top, the chart states there are **30,247** total public road miles in Wyoming. This is the broadest category.\n\n2.  **Wyoming Federal-Aid System Miles:** Beneath the total, the chart shows that **7,970** miles are part of the Wyoming Federal-Aid System. This is a subset of the total public road miles.\n\n3.  **Breakdown of Wyoming Federal-Aid System Miles:** The 7,970 Federal-Aid System Miles are further divided into two categories:\n    *   **Federal-Aid NHS Miles:** There are **3,975** miles designated as Federal-Aid National Highway System (NHS) miles.\n    *   **Other Federal-Aid Road Miles:** There are **3,995** miles categorized as other Federal-Aid road miles.\n    *(Note: 3,975 + 3,995 = 7,970, confirming the breakdown.)*\n\n4.  **Breakdown of Federal-Aid NHS Miles:** The 3,975 Federal-Aid NHS Miles are further detailed into:\n    *   **Non-Interstate NHS Miles:** There are **3,062** miles of non-interstate roads within the Federal-Aid NHS.\n    *   **Interstate Miles:** There are **913** miles of interstate roads, which are also part of the Federal-Aid NHS.\n    *(Note: 3,062 + 913 = 3,975, confirming the breakdown.)*\n\n**Summary of Data and Trends:**\nThe chart effectively illustrates the composition of Wyoming's road network, starting from the overall public road mileage and drilling down into the specifics of federal-aid roads. It highlights that federal-aid system roads constitute a significant portion (7,970 out of 30,247 miles) of the state's infrastructure. Within the federal-aid system, the mileage is nearly evenly split between NHS and other federal-aid roads. Furthermore, the majority of Federal-Aid NHS miles are non-interstate, with interstate miles making up a smaller but critical component.

WYDOT uses PMS analysis to compile the list of recommended pavement sections and associated treatment strategies. WYDOT applies different pavement preservation treatments at strategic times, from resurfacing to reconstruction, to achieve an optimal benefit-cost—in other words, the best bang for the state's buck!\n\nTo align with federal reporting, WYDOT uses a Pavement Quality Rating system that defines pavement sections as Good, Fair, or Poor. Overall, most interstate pavement is in Fair or Good condition while most non-interstate National Highway System (NHS) and non-NHS pavement is in Fair or Poor condition. WYDOT continually enhances pavement efficiency, reduces waste, and stretches funding to meet its pavement preservation goals. As part of these efforts, the Materials Program recycled 19.90 miles of roadway in southwest Wyoming in 2023 by using hot in-place recycling. The hot in-place recycling rehabilitates deteriorated pavements to correct surface distresses and preserve existing surface materials with minimal traveler impacts. Additionally, Materials followed an industry transition from traditional Portland cement to a newer, more sustainable Portland-limestone cement that uses limestone as a filler to reduce environmental impacts. These advancements are just some of the ways WYDOT continually innovates and improves pavement efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n**WYDOT's design and construction team received the silver prize for the American Concrete Pavement Association's Annual National Excellence in Concrete Pavement Awards - Divided Highways (Rural) category for the concrete pavement placed on I-80 (Rock Springs to Rawlins).**\n\n### FY23 WYOMING PAVEMENT RATINGS BY SYSTEM\n\n|      | INTERSTATE | NON-INTERSTATE NHS | NON-NHS |\n| ---- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------- |\n| GOOD | \\~15%      | \\~10%              | \\~10%   |\n| FAIR | \\~65%      | \\~60%              | \\~90%   |\n| POOR | \\~20%      | \\~30%              | \\~0%    |\n\n\n## BRIDGES\n\nWYDOT uses a Bridge Management System (BMS) to select bridge projects and replacement candidates. Using National Highway Performance Program (NHPP) targets (in effect since May 20, 2017), WYDOT strategically selects bridge projects to achieve its targets of maintaining at least 10 percent of bridge deck area in good condition while ensuring no more than10 percent is in poor condition for both NHS and non-NHS bridges. To meet performance targets, WYDOT diligently inspects structures, completing 1,537 routine inspections (1,047 on-system\n\n### FY23 WYOMING BRIDGE PERFORMANCE RATINGS BY SYSTEM\n\n|      | ALL NHS BRIDGES | ALL NON-NHS BRIDGES (STATE SYSTEM) | CITY/COUNTY BRIDGES |\n| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |\n| GOOD | \\~10%           | \\~10%                              | \\~10%               |\n| FAIR | \\~70%           | \\~90%                              | \\~80%               |\n| POOR | \\~20%           | \\~0%                               | \\~10%               |\n\n\nPAGE 16\n",

        "text": "[VISUAL DATA EXTRACT]\nType: Chart/Graph/Map\nSummary: , this page image contains two data charts. Both are stacked bar charts illustrating performance ratings by system, categorized into 'Good', 'Fair', and 'Poor' conditions, represented by green, yellow, and brown segments respectively. The Y-axis for both charts represents percentages from 0% to 100%.\n\nHere's a detailed description of each chart:\n\n**1. FY23 WYOMING PAVEMENT RATINGS BY SYSTEM**\nThis stacked bar chart displays the condition of Wyoming's pavement across three different road systems for Fiscal Year 2023.\n*   **Interstate Pavement:** The first bar represents Interstate pavements. Approximately 55% of Interstate pavements are rated as 'Good', about 35% are rated as 'Fair', and roughly 10% are in 'Poor' condition. This indicates that the majority of Interstate pavements are in good condition.\n*   **Non-Interstate NHS Pavement:** The second bar shows the ratings for Non-Interstate National Highway System (NHS) pavements. Around 15% of these pavements are 'Good', a significant 65% to 70% are rated as 'Fair', and about 20% are in 'Poor' condition. Compared to Interstates, a much smaller percentage is in good condition, and a larger percentage is in poor condition, with the majority being fair.\n*   **Non-NHS Pavement:** The third bar represents Non-NHS pavements. Approximately 10% of Non-NHS pavements are 'Good', about 75% are 'Fair', and roughly 15% are in 'Poor' condition. This category has the highest percentage of pavements in 'Fair' condition and the lowest percentage in 'Good' condition, suggesting this system generally has the least optimal pavement quality among the three categories.\n\n**Overall Trend for Pavement Ratings:** Interstate pavements generally have the best ratings, with more than half in good condition. Non-Interstate NHS and Non-NHS pavements show a similar pattern, with a large majority in fair condition and a smaller percentage in good condition, and a notable portion in poor condition.\n\n**2. FY23 WYOMING BRIDGE PERFORMANCE RATINGS BY SYSTEM**\nThis second stacked bar chart presents the condition of Wyoming's bridges, also for Fiscal Year 2023, across three different bridge categories.\n*   **All NHS Bridges:** The first bar indicates the ratings for all National Highway System (NHS) bridges. Approximately 25% of these bridges are rated as 'Good', about 70% are 'Fair', and only a small portion, around 5%, are in 'Poor' condition. This suggests that the vast majority of NHS bridges are in acceptable, if not optimal, condition.\n*   **All Non-NHS Bridges (State System):** The second bar represents all Non-NHS bridges managed by the State System. Similar to NHS bridges, about 25% are rated 'Good', around 70% are 'Fair', and roughly 5% are in 'Poor' condition. The performance ratings for state-managed Non-NHS bridges are almost identical to those of NHS bridges.\n*   **City/County Bridges:** The third bar shows the ratings for City/County Bridges. About 30% of these bridges are rated as 'Good', approximately 55% are 'Fair', and a larger portion, about 15%, are in 'Poor' condition. This category has the highest percentage of bridges in 'Good' condition, but also a significantly higher percentage in 'Poor' condition compared to the other two bridge categories.\n\n**Overall Trend for Bridge Ratings:** Both NHS and State System Non-NHS bridges show consistently high percentages in 'Fair' condition and very low percentages in 'Poor' condition. City/County bridges have a slightly higher 'Good' rating but also a noticeably higher 'Poor' rating, indicating a more varied performance across this category",

The Bridge Program also completed the following types of inspections on different structures in 2023:\n\n- 13 initial bridge inspections\n- 41 elemental update inspections\n- 37 fracture critical inspections\n- 10 tunnel inspections\n- 33 overhead sign structure inspections\n- 242 high mast light tower inspections\n- 17 bridge damage inspections\n\nIn 2023, WYDOT also let a record of over $92.858 million in bridge work to contract, achieving its performance targets on the NHS and non-NHS. This work consisted of the following:\n\n- 8 bridge replacements\n- 37 bridge rehabilitations\n- 2 box culverts\n- 1 retaining wall\n- 3 miscellaneous structures\n\nWork for future bridge replacements also began, with the Geology Program completing drilling investigations for 17 bridge replacements. WYDOT will continue to leverage federal funding to replace bridges in poor condition.\n\n## WYOLINK\n\nOver 500 entities use WyoLink's 105 network radio sites, and new users are continually added. WyoLink users include:\n\n- 68 emergency medical services\n- 94 law enforcement agencies\n- 118 fire protection agencies\n- 144 local government agencies\n- 20 Wyoming state agencies\n- 44 educational institutions\n- 2 federal agencies\n- 11 out-of-state agencies\n- 19 private entities (mine rescue and Life Flights)\n- Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Wind River Indian Reservation\n\n**Wyolink has 105 network radio sites serving 16,000 users and about 21.7M calls annually**\n\nThe Emergency Communications Program ensures the vital WyoLink system remains reliable for the life saving services that depend on it. As part of this ongoing effort, in 2023 Emergency Communications completed radio upgrades at 65 sites and across 50 percent of WYDOT mobile and portable radios.\n\n## AERONAUTICS\n\nWYDOT also applies asset management to airports to help facilitate safe and reliable air travel. The Engineering and Construction Program provides airport asset management with work continuing in 2023 on a statewide GIS-based airport pavement management program. To further improve aeronautics assets and air service, the Engineering and Construction Program also oversaw various projects to support Wyoming aviation, including the following:\n\n- 53 design, construction, and equipment acquisition projects\n- 21 navigational aid maintenance projects\n- 20 aviation encouragement projects\n- 7 marketing projects\n\nBeyond caring for physical airport infrastructure, WYDOT also oversees air service development. The Air Service Development Program helped fund nine air service agreements in FY23—five through the Air Service Enhancement Program (ASEP) and four through the Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA). The ASEP agreements provided air service for more than 136,000 passengers while the CPA\n\nPAGE 17\n",

The Design Section completed 67 design projects, and the Contracts and Estimates (C&E) team oversaw 68 highway contracts awarded (some for combined projects), with the majority awarded to in-state bidders. Projects averaged 2.3 bidders, which was a lower average than for previous years. Most highway contracts were federally funded (62 projects), and the total construction cost was $392 million—a notable $22 million increase over FY22.\n\n*It's a bird. It's a plane. No! It's the P&S plane! The survey crew flew 10 flights over the Padlock pit, collecting 1,194 photos over 380 acres, and used the Skydio 2+ drone over the Willey Scoria Pit (point cloud below) to collect 424 photos over 138 acres.*\n\nOf the projects let to contract in FY23, the Highway Development Program worked on 10 interstate system projects, 2 wildlife projects, 11 HSIP projects, 2 emergency projects, 5 state and federal system bridge replacements and rehabilitations, and 5 maintenance projects. Looking to the future, WYDOT's Project Development Section prepared $183.8 million in projects for FY24 lettings and $238.6 million in projects ready for letting beyond FY24. To aid design work, the Photogrammetry and Surveys Section (P&S) provided\n\nterrain mapping, aerial photography, surveying, and data for designers and other programs. In 2023, this work involved the Photogrammetry Group compiling mapping for 58 projects, including work on 10 urban projects, 20 rural projects, 18 bridge projects, and 2 pit and quarries. The Surveys Group placed photo targets and collected data for aerial imagery on 13 projects. Further, P&S set 219 project control monuments on 22 projects, collected Global Positioning System (GPS) control data on 30 projects, and collected digital-level data for vertical control on 26 projects—providing valuable coordinates that are used for mapping, design, land surveying, and construction.\n\nTo further prepare for highway construction, the Right of Way Program (ROW) acquired 165 parcels on 39 projects in 2023, including the following acquisitions:\n\n- 31 parcels for Poplar Street in Casper\n- 15 parcels for Thermopolis-Meeteetse\n- 16 parcels for 3rd Street in Laramie\n- 14 parcels for Evanston streets\n\n### FY23 INTERSTATE PROJECTS BY SYSTEM\n\n| **I-25**<br/>$80.40 M<br/>(49%) | **FY23 TOTAL PROJECTS LET ON INTERSTATE SYSTEM**<br/>$165.9M | **I-90**<br/>$23.90 M<br/>(14%) |\n| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| **I-80**<br/>$61.60 M<br/>(37%) |                                                              |                                 |\n\n\n",

This dedication to timely design work is shown in the 53 new consultant contracts issued by the Consultant Services Unit, with the majority (39) going to in-state firms—an 89 percent increase from FY22. In FY23, new contracts totaled $23.51 million for a 131 percent increase from FY22. Payments totaling $15.023 million were made on 115 agreements with 60 firms.\n\nJim Perkins and Jason Potter reviewing plans\n\n## WYDOT GETS THE JOB DONE\n\nThrough 2023's historically brutal winter and short summer, WYDOT crews worked on vital projects to keep our transportation system in the best possible condition given funding and staffing constraints. Despite vacancies continuing to stretch crews, workers across WYDOT completed important construction and maintenance work.\n\n## CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS\n\nFrom mill and overlay projects to larger reconstructions, WYDOT completed many necessary improvements to ensure Wyoming's transportation infrastructure remains in good overall condition.\n\n*District 1* administered roughly $61.2 million of work in FY23 with the highlight being the Curtis Street bridge replacement over I-80 in Laramie. The bridge was replaced in about 90 working days, an extraordinary accomplishment for Reiman Corp. and WYDOT. District 1 also completed several safety-focused projects including a pedestrian bridge repair in Cheyenne near McCormick Junior High and several urban systems projects in Cheyenne, Laramie, and Rawlins. *District 2* focused on larger projects in the Casper area, including the Casper Marginal (see the **Project Highlights** section for more information on this exciting project) while finishing remaining bridge repairs and paving projects. *District 3* let multiple construction projects while work continued on project already in progress, including the Snake River bridge reconstruction on WY 22 in Teton County along with the reconfiguration of the WY22/WY 390 intersection. *District 4* saw 11 projects let to contract including Sheridan Main Street (costing about $17.955 million); I-90. Sundance to State Line Section ($15.16 million); I-25 Kaycee to Buffalo, District Boundary Section ($11.321 million); Buffalo to Gillette, Wildhorse Creek Section ($8.762 million); and 65 miles of mill and overlay projects. *District 5* completed asphalt pavement overlays and chip seals for 10 out of the 18 projects completed in FY23. Other projects included slope flattening between Thermopolis and Worland (US 20/ WY 789); erosion repair on Chief Joseph Scenic Highway (WY 296); two bridge rehabilitations and the Cottonwood Creek bridge replacement; tunnel lighting in the US 14/16/20 tunnel west of Cody; pipe lining and siphon replacement; a guardrail project; traffic signal detection system installation in Cody; and a pedestrian pier/river channel repair south of Riverton.\n\nWY 22 and WY 390 intersection and bridge job in Jackson\n\nPAGE 19\n",

With crews spread thin, districts were generous with helping each other. District 5, for instance, provided snow removal assistance to other districts in Winter 2023. Using asset assessments, crews went to work to meet infrastructure quality thresholds, completing major fence and delineation repairs, irrigation and drainage work, erosion repair and control, and daily litter control and carcass removal.\n\n## TRAFFIC PROGRAMS\n\nWYDOT's Traffic Program, district traffic crews, and other programs are integral to ensuring Wyoming roads are safe and easily navigable. Notably in 2023, the Standards Unit helped bring WYDOT's roadside safety hardware into compliance with the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH). To advance safe and efficient traffic operations, the Traffic Program collected and provided turning movement analysis and capacity analysis to inform projects and ensure optimal traffic flow.\n\n*Paving along Main Street in Sheridan*\n\n*Striping* crews went to work applying paint as supply issues eased from previous years. The Traffic Program executed purchasing contracts for 282,250 gallons of paint and 964,000 pounds of glass beads for highway striping and provided mobile striping retroflective and striping details for numerous projects.\n\n*Signage* starts with the Sign Shop, which manufactured 4,893 signs in 2023. Traffic completed 82 projects that contained permanent signage and work zone traffic control while providing numerous operational sign layout requests. District sign crews stayed busy with sign inspections, repairs, and replacements. In District 2, crews repaired or replaced almost 800 signs; while in District 5, crews completed annual inspections for more than 5,000 highway signs.\n\n*Signals and Lighting* were also a focus for traffic crews. Notably, the Traffic Program, Construction Program, and District 5 collaborated on important lighting system and ventilation system upgrades for the Cody tunnels in 2023. The new adaptive LED lighting system improves lighting conditions for drivers while using less power than the previous system, resulting in lower operating costs and improved safety for WYDOT traffic crews maintaining the system.\n\n*District 4 striping operations*\n\nPAGE 20\n",

NATURE\n\nLarge portions of Wyoming received above average snowfall during Winter 2023, with certain areas experiencing historical snow accumulations and significant traveler impacts. Carbon County received accumulations within the top 10 percent of historical snowfalls that closed roads and kept district crews busy. WYDOT crews assisted the City of Rawlins by shifting 136 personnel to bolster snow control efforts and eclipsing District 1's snow control budget by over $2 million. Despite a record winter, Mother Nature was merciful with a mild spring, yet WYDOT still monitored and mitigated landslides, flooding, and rock falls.\n\nWith the help of uncontrolled mapping by the Photogrammetry Group, the Geology Program determined how fast and how much movement occurred with P&S collecting aerial imagery on 34 landslides for geologists. To support monitoring, the Geology Program installed 5 new slope inclinometers, making for 208 total active slope inclinometers statewide.\n\nMonitoring led to swift mitigation on multiple landslides. During an existing slide repair on I-90 south of Sheridan, additional movement required further mitigation. Despite slides threatening to impede access to popular tourist destinations, WYDOT's quick response helped retain access, especially on US 14 where multiple slides occurred. A new slide near the Antelope Butte Ski Area required an emergency repair contract, and mitigation on the Little Tongue River slide west of Ranchester was let to contract to prevent anticipated road damage that threatened access to the Bighorn National Forest and Bighorn Basin. A new, particularly large, slide cropped up on US 14 in Shell Canyon that WYDOT stabilized before the snowmelt and spring rains wreaked further havoc.\n\nAs part of WYDOT's prevention efforts, during winter weather in a remote mountain canyon, about 300 feet above the roadway, Geology, District 5, and a drilling contractor removed and replaced a pump for a high capacity dewatering well. The old well was installed in 1970 and constantly pumped 400,000 gallons of water per day until failing in 2022. Replacing the pump was critical to avoid landslide hazards.\n\nWhether stabilizing landslides, scaling canyon walls, plowing snow, or preparing for future hazards, WYDOT crews work together to help you get where you need to go come rain, wind, or snow.\n\n*Mitigation efforts on the Little Tongue River Slide*\n\nPAGE 21\n",

Systems Planning applied for multiple grants including one for I-80 fracture critical bridge replacements and another for the Cheyenne College Drive grade separation. The Management Services Program wrote and submitted successful grant applications ranging from interchange design to truck parking and wildlife crossing projects. Notably, WYDOT received a $24.3 million Wildlife Crossing Pilot Program (WCPP) award making it the largest single WCPP grant award in the country. These applications are a team effort across multiple programs.\n\n**$13M I-80/I-25 INTERCHANGE DESIGN**\n\n**$26.6M I-80 EVANSTON TRUCK PARKING DESIGN/CONSTRUCTION**\n\n**$24.3M US 189 WILDLIFE CROSSING CORRIDOR DESIGN/CONSTRUCTION**\n\n## HIGH MAST LIGHT TOWERS\n\nHigh mast light tower failure is a nationwide problem, and WYDOT's research in this area has resulted in national design standards. In 2023, the Bridge Program completed wind tunnel testing and design for new towers and, with the Traffic Program, installed a test tower at Dwyer Junction rest area. As a result, WYDOT began replacing all high mast towers in the state.\n\n## WEIGHT RESTRICTED CLOSURES\n\nIn response to an increasing number of blow-over crashes, WYDOT piloted a new alert system to prevent blow-overs and provide more information to travelers during high wind events. Based on University of Wyoming (UW) blow-over\n\nPAGE 23\n",

On the right side, there are three text sections describing \"DISCRETIONARY GRANTS,\" \"HIGH MAST LIGHT TOWERS,\" and \"WEIGHT RESTRICTED CLOSURES.\"\n\nOn the left side of the lower half, three visual elements are stacked vertically, each associated with a project. Two of these are aerial views that function as maps to illustrate specific project locations and their scope:\n\n1.  **I-80/I-25 Interchange Design (Map):** This is an aerial photograph depicting a complex highway interchange. The map shows a dense network of intersecting roads and ramps, clearly illustrating the multi-level configuration of a major interstate (likely I-80) connecting with another highway (I-25). Some surrounding terrain and a few buildings are visible, but the focus is on the intricate road infrastructure. A subtle blue line outlines a specific section of the interchange, likely indicating the area of the design project. A prominent yellow circular callout is overlaid on this map, containing the text: \"$13M I-80/I-25 INTERCHANGE DESIGN.\" This indicates a 13 million dollar project focused on the design of this particular interchange.\n\n2.  **I-80 Evanston Truck Parking Design/Construction (Map):** Positioned below the interchange map, this is another aerial photograph. It presents a large truck parking facility, seen during winter with snow covering the ground. The map clearly shows numerous semi-trucks (tractors and trailers) parked in organized rows across an expansive paved area. Several buildings are visible adjacent to the parking lot. This visual serves as a map to show the layout and considerable scale of the truck parking area. A yellow circular callout is placed over this image, stating: \"$26.6M I-80 EVANSTON TRUCK PARKING DESIGN/CONSTRUCTION.\" This signifies a 26.6 million dollar project for the design and construction of this truck parking facility along I-80 in Evanston.\n\nThe third visual on the left is a ground-level photograph of an antelope in a snowy field with a fence, illustrating a wildlife crossing project, and is not a map or diagram itself",

WYDOT now posts road closures for vehicles under certain gross vehicle weights (based on wind conditions) using dynamic messaging signs and ports of entry to better define vulnerable vehicles while keeping roads open for vehicles unlikely to blow over. Working closely with ITS and WHP, PAO also launched an information campaign to educate the public on the new system. The next phase will create a pre-event system to show expected wind closures by weight and recommend windows of opportunity for drivers to proceed.\n\n## CASPER MARGINAL\n\nHighway Development and District 2 let the Casper Marginal project for $57.7 million in 2023. For this multi-faceted project, teams designed horizontal and vertical alignments, cross-sectional elements, and other critical components while coordinating with ROW, property owners, and regulatory agencies to strategically facilitate right-of-way acquisitions. These impressive design efforts resulted in an equally impressive construction project, which includes the following aspects:\n\n**I-25 Reconstruction:** replaces all I-25 structures over the North Platte River.\n\n**F Street Realignment:** realigns and reconstructs a portion of F Street.\n\n**Storm Drain System:** installs an updated storm drain system, complete with a Stormceptor filtration unit, to effectively manage storm water runoff while protecting the North Platte River.\n\n**Ramp Refinement:** widens ramps to 24 feet for safer, easier movement on and off the highway.\n\n**Retaining Walls:** constructs retaining walls at strategic locations to overcome clearance and right-of-way challenges while providing stability and aesthetic appeal.\n\n**Bike Path Connection:** crafts a bike path to integrate the F Street bridge and pedestrian path with the existing route under the structure, which involved careful alignment to promote safe and convenient biking.\n\nThese improvements will substantially enhance safety, efficiency, and the overall travel experience along this crucial corridor in one of Wyoming's most densely populated areas.\n\n*Casper Marginal work (top to bottom) demolition, girder placement, deck pour, retaining wall*\n\n[Images show: Construction equipment including excavator and SANY machinery performing demolition work, girder placement showing yellow structural beams, deck pour with reinforcement mesh and crane, and retaining wall construction site]\n\nPAGE 24",

The program **managed 1,849 permitted outdoor advertising structures**, processed **2 new permits**, and **revoked 71 permits**. ROW managed the Junkyard Control Program, regulating **51 junk and salvage yards**.\n\n**TRAFFIC** advanced the Cody tunnel lighting upgrade, and the ELECTRICAL DESIGN SECTION completed **13 projects** representing **$8.2 million in electrical work**.\n\n**GEOLOGY** provided **construction support on nine different projects**, including pile driving monitoring, landslide repair, drilled shaft inspection, tie back anchor inspection, and rock scaling inspection. The program assisted with an emergency rock scaling project in the Wind River Canyon and with Bridge Program highway tunnel inspections. The program **completed 297 test holes** and **7,087 feet of drilling and digging** for subsurface investigations. The *Geotechnical Foundation Lab* **tested 692 soil** and **46 geotextile samples**.\n\n**DISTRICT 1** prioritized safety with an annual safety summit and a comprehensive safety training calendar. MAINTENANCE assisted in the Agile Chariot Air Force exercise, which successfully landed a C-130, two A-10 fighter jets, an MQ-9 Reaper, and two MH-6M Little Bird helicopters on US 287 north of Rawlins. TRAFFIC reviewed access permits, traffic impact studies, pedestrian safety, and more. Working with MAINTENANCE, TRAFFIC updated all Adopt-a-Highway signs districtwide. EQUIPMENT crews in Cheyenne and Rawlins received new LaRue T-80 rotary plow units.\n\n**DISTRICT 2** focused on safety, recruiting, and training with great success—a 20 percent decreased vacancy rate. With the new recruits, MAINTENANCE worked in inclement weather to keep roads clear while maintaining fences, pipes, bridges, guardrails, and facilities. TRAFFIC ensured signing and electrical systems remained functional while EQUIPMENT received a new LaRue truck-mounted snow blower, which is 50 percent larger than the 40 year-old unit it replaced.\n\n**District 3** emphasized safety and training while trying to recruit to combat staffing shortages. MAINTENANCE continued working with the US Forest Service on managing highway use, recreational use, and local interests in the Teton Pass area. TRAFFIC reviewed and approved access permits and striped thousands of miles of highway. EQUIPMENT performed maintenance and inspections on hundreds of pieces of equipment, including preventative maintenance.\n\nPAGE 25\n",

The department supports multimodal transportation, administers driver's licenses and other services, and provides internal services that keep the agency's wheels turning to better serve the public.\n\n## BEYOND ROADS AND BRIDGES\n\nWYDOT supports local governments, communities, and other transportation stewards to enable a robust, multimodal transportation system. From managing pass-through funding for local pathway projects and transit providers, to supporting freight rail service, WYDOT ensures people and products stay connected and keep moving.\n\n### MULTI-USE PATHWAY\n\nThe Local Government Coordination office awards pass-through federal funding to cities, towns, and counties through the Transportation Alternatives Program, Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, and HRRR. To ensure pedestrian safety, connectivity, and equity, the Civil Rights Program, along with other WYDOT programs, contracted with Street Smart in 2023 to compile data on Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) facilities on the pedestrian circulation path within WYDOT's rights-of-way as it relates to curb ramps, sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian signals.\n\n### TRANSIT\n\nMost Wyoming transit providers are extremely small yet provide vital mobility and connectivity for often older, disabled, or low-income persons. Notably, a growing number of folks outside of traditional transit riders are beginning to use these services. For all current and potential users, WYDOT works with dedicated providers to leverage federal funding for the best possible service despite challenging rural conditions. In FY23, more fixed route trips (916,893 trips) were taken versus on-demand service trips (430,515 trips). Both fixed-route and on-demand services were used the most for personal purposes, though other popular transit uses included fixed-route service to access education and on-demand service to commute home.\n\n**WY has over 45 transit providers, including intercity bus providers, serving 1.347M trips in FY23.**\n\n**WY has 5 railroad carriers and over 1,700 route miles**\n\n### FREIGHT RAIL\n\nAlthough WYDOT cannot own or operate rail, it does work with railroad companies to ensure rail and communities coexist safely while supporting the economy. To this end, the ROW Program completed\n\nPAGE 26\n",

WYDOT provides limited air service to state officials as well as supports Wyoming airports and air service. In 2023, the Flight Operations Program provided on-demand air service to 21 state agencies, commissions, public boards, and elected officials. The program flew 592 flight segments and transported 2,011 passengers. Compared to FY22, FY23 saw a 2 percent increase in flight hours and passengers.\n\nTo support airport improvements in FY23, Aviation Planning Program administered $5.1 million in state funds and $60.1 million in federal pass-through funds. WYDOT facilitated airport improvement grants for 155 projects at 35 airports including major projects in Casper, Cheyenne, Cody, Douglas, Jackson, Riverton, and others. These projects served a variety of purposes, including safety, maintenance, security, enhancement, and planning. Aviation Planning also allocated an additional $2.1 million in state funds from the Wyoming Aeronautics Commission's statewide line item programs, which include crack seal, aviation encouragement, marketing and promotions, and navigational aid maintenance.\n\n## OFF THE ROADS AND IN THE OFFICE\n\nWYDOT's top priority is serving its customers, whether ensuring safe travel to important destinations or administering specialty plates so Wyomingites can ride in style. WYDOT helps its customers on and off the road. Perhaps the most direct interaction between WYDOT and the public is through non-infrastructure services, such as driver's licenses, specialty plates, state-assigned vehicle identification numbers (VINs), and similar services. Less obvious forms of customer service occur when WYDOT works with transportation stakeholders, such as businesses, local public agencies, and the Wyoming Legislature. For instance, though it may not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking customer service, the Utilities Section provides one-on-one support to companies that use the utilities online permitting software.\n\nWith over 25 Driver Services exam stations spread statewide for customer convenience, the Driver Services Program is on the front lines of WYDOT's customer service presence, completing about 199,000 customer transactions in FY23. These services included:\n\nAs of December 2023, WY has **454,385 licensed drivers**, and of those, **34,701 hold a CDL/CLP**. About **13,000 drivers renewed their license through the mail**.\n\n» Issuing driver's licenses and identification cards (IDs)  \n» Providing driving records  \n» Issuing disabled placards\n\n» Collecting reinstatement fees  \n» Other transactions\n\nBeyond normal customer service operations, Driver Services also worked with Wyoming's Military Affairs Department to streamline the process for honorably discharged veterans to add the VETERAN designation to their Wyoming license or ID.\n\nAnother common touch point for customers, the Motor Vehicle Services (MVS) Program completed title searches and issued state assigned VINs, generating over $39,000 in revenue while bringing in an additional $644,590 from issuing dealership and rental licenses. Perhaps the most frequent customer service MVS provides is managing Wyoming's popular specialty license plates. In 2023, MVS collected $188,248 for specialty plates. In accordance with state statute, MVS's Plate Production team also began producing and delivering the new 2025 license plates, producing 231,338 in 2023.\n\nPAGE 27\n",

MAINTENANCE **placed 26,434 tons of locally supplied hot mix asphalt. TRAFFIC expended 97 percent of its budgeted program**, completed its annual work plans, and managed access permits for the many new subdivisions and developments around the district. EQUIPMENT completed snow removal equipment repairs, annual inspections, and necessary repairs generated by annual inspections despite experiencing difficulties obtaining parts and supplies.\n\n**District 5** CONSTRUCTION projects included asphalt pavement preservation on US 287 (Muddy Gap portion), US 287/WY 789 (Lander section), and WY 789 (Riverton to Shoshoni); pavement overlay and chip seal on US 26/287 (Moran Junction to Dubois), Gooseberry Road, US 14/16/20 (Yellowstone to Cody), US 310 (Deaver to Montana state line), WY 294 (Ralston-Badger Basin), US 14A (Garland to Byron), and US 14A (Lovell to Burgess Junction). MAINTENANCE responded to the Cootie slide, the Junior slide in the Wind River Canyon, several smaller landslides, and erosion events in Fremont County. Crews also **chip sealed more than 47 miles**. TRAFFIC rebuilt the complex paint and bead delivery systems on the striping trucks, upgraded Adopt-A-Highway signs, and completed annual inspections on **all 48 traffic signal systems**.\n\n**PLANNING** created plans to meet IIJA requirements, including the *Wyoming Statewide Freight Improvement Plan*, *Carbon Reduction Plan*, the *National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan*, and the *Risk and Resilience Plan*. SYSTEMS PLANNING secured hydrogen alternative fuels corridor designations for interstate routes and submitted the particulate matter (PM) 2 and PM3 biennial performance measure results and targets to FHWA, receiving approval to exempt all projects within the Upper Green River non-attainment area from conformance review. ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES provided environmental review and compliance guidance for multiple projects working with other programs and district staff. The section **prepared National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents for 90 projects** and provided project management for the combined WY 22 and Tribal Trails project in Teton County as well as the US 30 road relocation. The section installed game cameras to monitor the nine wildlife crossing structures at the recently completed Dry Piney wildlife crossings. Cultural staff processed five historical bridge mitigations and completed multiple cultural reviews.\n\nPAGE 28\n",

This project will replace the current system, referred to as RIS, that has been used since 1986. The modernized system is referred to as the Transportation Information System (TIS).\n\nFY23 saw existing work continue on the modernization while new work began. After a request for proposal (RFP)—managed by the Procurement Services Program—Kyndrl was selected to began the modernization process. Driver Services started its part, which focuses on correcting existing deficiencies and adding new capabilities to increase\n\nefficiencies and enhance customer service. The new system will provide customers with an online portal offering a 360-degree view of their existing information in the system. Further, this online portal will provide new tools that will allow customers to complete certain services, receive answers to questions, and better understand Driver Services' processes.\n\nSome modernization processes were already underway and continued in 2023 before the contract to Kyndrl was awarded. A key component of preparing for TIS was preparing data, and the IT Program was vital in collaborating with MathTech during this process. MVS also spent countless hours describing data and data processes to MathTech to help inform the RFP regarding the title registration part of TIS. Additionally, the Compliance and Investigation Program continued to offer insights based on the new system's impact on compliance. TIS completion is slated for 2025.\n\n## HELPING US HELP YOU\n\nSometimes the most overlooked services are the internal services that help outward facing programs better serve our customers. Without these internal services, WYDOT could not meet its mission.\n\n### THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB\n\nMultiple WYDOT programs help obtain and maintain tools, equipment, software, and more used to get the job done efficiently and effectively. WYDOT must follow certain procurement requirements to ensure a fair process for interested bidders and companies. The Procurement Services Program serves on the front lines of ensuring WYDOT forces have the proper equipment and systems for optimal operations. In 2023, Procurement Services facilitated three notable RFPs that had a significant impact on improving WYDOT operations:\n\n» **Track Type Asphalt Paving Machine:** This new machine was needed for paving operations in the Thermopolis area. Honnen Equipment Company was awarded the contract for $566,942.00.\n\n» **TIS Transition:** As noted before, the RIS modernization will provide new and exciting capabilities\n\nPAGE 29\n",

In District 2, a 40-year old truck-mounted snow blower was finally replaced with a significantly larger unit to improve snow removal operations.\n\nBeyond standard equipment—like plows, sanders, bush mowers, pavers, and more—WYDOT crews also rely on innovative, specialty equipment, such as drones. The Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Program works with WYDOT crews to develop innovative ways to deploy drones (or UAS) to enhance efficiencies and effectiveness. In 2023, UAS worked extensively with a WYDOT task force (formed in 2020) to further integrate drone use in program operations by identifying deployment opportunities with the greatest benefit.\n\nIn the office, specialty equipment is also used to boost productivity and efficiency, such as the Mailing Services Section's new inserter, which replaced its old inserter that had processed over 100,000 documents. The new inserter enabled staff to fold and insert 188,530 documents in 2023 alone.\n\nDistrict 4 new LaRue rotary snow plow gets to work opening US 14A.",

FY23 saw essentially every WYDOT employee engage in a WYDOT-delivered learning opportunity—completing 4,560 employee development opportunities. Employees continued to prefer online learning, which accounted for 82 percent of training completions.\n\n**WYDOT's revised Tuition Reimbursement Program provided $12,012 in tuition support for 11 employees.**\n\nIn a significant step towards growing agency leadership, the Training Services Program, in collaboration with other WYDOT programs, established a new WY Advancing Leaders Academy (WY Leads) in 2023. The first cohort included 15 employees who represented a cross-section of WYDOT. Participants applied and were selected by existing WYDOT leadership. The selected employees attended nine sessions, including presentations from various WYDOT programs. WY Leads also included mentorship from executive staff and capstone projects presented to executive staff. To further enrich the experience, a roundtable discussion—captured on video by PAO—featured state agency leaders across Wyoming for a wider look at leadership beyond WYDOT. After completing the academy, participants provided valuable feedback to improve the experience for future cohorts.\n\nWYDOT employees also gained valuable knowledge and skills from other learning opportunities, such as WYDOT University classes and WY Supervise: New Supervisor's Program. Employees continued to rate WYDOT University classes highly, reporting improved behaviors and learning gains.\n\nBeyond learning facilitated by Training Services, other programs provided training to fellow WYDOT personnel. For instance, Environmental Services provided environmental/NEPA training for two districts and Project Design staff. Civil Rights trained new supervisors and new hires on Title VI non-discrimination, and Maintenance trainers also provided equipment training and commercial driver's license (CDL) testing for WYDOT personnel. Notably, the Maintenance Program established an internal CDL Training Program to better prepare WYDOT personnel to pass CDL testing required by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). Equipment technician training was also prevalent across WYDOT to ensure crews safely and effectively handle equipment. Training topics included hydraulic diagnostics, welding, electric systems diagnostic, machining/lathe, Detroit engine/after treatment systems, Vogele paver, Larue snow blower, and vehicle lift safety. Additionally, the WHP Safety and Training Section submitted 575 training courses to the Wyoming Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission (POST) for accreditation and processed hundreds of individual training requests for the professional advancement for our agency personnel.\n\n### FY23 EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT\n\n|                        | FY19  | FY20  | FY21   | FY22  | FY23  |\n| ---------------------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- |\n| NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS | 840   | 1,116 | 1,685  | 1,808 | 1,851 |\n| TOTAL COMPLETIONS      | 6,098 | 7,255 | 10,610 | 5,370 | 4,560 |\n\n\nPAGE 31\n",

This outreach helps WYDOT establish and maintain strategic partnerships that help us serve our customers' needs better and achieve our mission.\n\n## PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT\n\nWYDOT uses both routine public communications and specialized information releases to keep the public and stakeholders informed. Between a dedicated Public Affairs Office (PAO) and district public information specialists, WYDOT reaches an expansive audience when informing the public or requesting input. PAO communicates routinely through various mediums and publications to maximize outreach. The Office Services Program prints and distributes these publications, including the following jobs produced in 2023:\n\n» Interchange (36,646 copies)\n\n» Wyoming Road Work Guide (13,200 copies)\n\n» Official State Highway Map\n\n» Highway Safety calendar (925 copies)\n\n» Highway Safety advertising campaigns\n\n» Posters\n\n» Information graphics\n\n» Brochures\n\nBeyond the printed word, PAO uses video news releases (releasing 52 weekly WYDOT Reports in 2023) and maintains an online presence with 5,870 YouTube subscribers and 60,000 Facebook subscribers. WYDOT's main Facebook page reached 2.2 million people in 2023, not including analytics from the district Facebook pages.\n\nFor specialized information releases in 2023—regarding projects, alerts, and more—Office Services sent out 6,839 postcards for District 1 alerting local residents of detours for the Curtis Street bridge demolition and produced 1,000 Construction and General OSHA books, 239 STIP books, 158 Materials Lab testing manuals, printed plans and proposals for 66 awarded bid letting jobs, and 50 state budget book copies for all Wyoming state agencies.\n\n*Curtis Street Bridge deck pour*\n\nPAGE 33\n",

The truck parking ribbon cutting even featured an in-person speech by FHWA Administrator Shailen Bhatt, an appearance PAO helped coordinate.\n\nProviding information to the public is not just a job for public information specialists either, multiple programs engage with the public, answer questions, and provide information to maintain transparency. For instance, the Maintenance Program fields many public information requests, and ROW completed 350 public and internal research requests in 2023. In the districts, public meetings and STIP meetings allow folks to talk with subject matter experts, inquire and comment about projects, and learn about construction impacts, traffic control, and project benefits.\n\n## STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND PARTNERSHIPS\n\nWYDOT works with a range of stakeholders and partners at the local, state, and federal levels. Engagement may take the form of education and training, joint initiatives, or policy changes—all for the benefit of Wyoming's transportation system and services.\n\n### LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS\n\nIn the districts, WYDOT partners with multiple agencies and local governments to accomplish local projects through cooperative agreements on WYDOT projects. WYDOT's Management Services Program also seeks local support from impacted cities, counties, non-government organizations, and others when pursuing discretionary grants. Ensuring local businesses, industry, and governments support WYDOT projects is integral to project success and meeting local needs. WYDOT also turns to communities for help. In 2023, work continued to secure necessary agreements for WYDOT to tie into the Teton County School District's sewage system for the proposed Jackson Housing Project. This housing project would provide more affordable housing for WYDOT employees to ensure WYDOT can meet regional transportation needs. Obtaining the necessary agreements is an important first step before WYDOT's architectural consultant can complete the construction plans for the proposed housing facility.\n\nLocal stakeholder engagement also takes the form of education and training. The Compliance and Investigation Program is a perfect example of WYDOT's commitment to outward education. In 2023, Compliance and Investigation provided onsite joint training for county clerks,\n\n![Group photo of seven people posing in front of a snow plow with \"CLEARAPATHRA\" written on it]\n\nDistrict 5 snow plow naming contest\n\nPAGE 34\n",

Compliance and Investigation staff created a comprehensive training manual to anchor sessions with topics including relevant state statutes, rules and regulations, and various documents used to sell, finance, and title vehicles after sale or transfer. In a testament to this training's effectiveness, Compliance and Investigation received a nearly 100 percent satisfaction rating. Another example of engagement through education was the grant presentation the Management Services Program gave during the first annual Federal Funding Summit. The presentation reached a wide audience\n\n*Public and advisory committee meetings for the planning of improvements for WY 22 between Jackson and Wilson.*\n\n[Image shows a meeting room with several people seated around tables during what appears to be a public meeting or committee session]\n\nof representatives from local governments, non-profits, industry, and more. Management Services, Highway Safety, and the Grants and Contracts programs also connected with many community and business leaders about specific projects and challenges statewide during the summit. Ensuring WYDOT is a reliable source of information related to transportation continues to be paramount for WYDOT's relationship building.\n\n## GOVERNMENT RELATIONS\n\nWYDOT's government relations take many forms, from monthly commission meetings to policy discussions with Wyoming's Congressional delegation.\n\n### Commissions\n\nWYDOT works with three commissions—each with Governor-appointed representatives from around Wyoming. WYDOT engages with each commission at least monthly to provide education and seek input on activities. A key piece of WYDOT's relationship and communication with the commissions depends on two dedicated commission secretaries.\n\nThe Aeronautics Division works closely with the Aeronautics Commission to administer airport improvement projects, approve Wyoming airport grants, encourage use of Wyoming airports, and support fly-ins and air shows. As part of its WyoLink stewardship, the Emergency Communications Program works with the Public Safety Communications Commission (PSCC) to recommend improvement strategies for Wyoming's wireless interoperability, determine WyoLink network standards, identify and create technological and policy solutions to develop WyoLink, and recommend legislation or other state action to advance wireless interoperability in Wyoming. Finally, WYDOT's entire executive staff works with the Transportation Commission to fulfill the department's duties. The Transportation Commission awards contracts for improvements undertaken with State Highway Fund monies, adopts WYDOT's rules and regulations, and oversees broad transportation policy emphasis areas.\n\nPAGE 35\n",

        "text": "\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\n## Agencies\n\nWYDOT partners with state and federal agencies to ensure Wyoming's transportation system meets the needs of all who rely on it. In 2023, the Maintenance Program partnered with other state agencies on environmental, wildlife, natural disaster, and emergency management issues to coordinate swift responses and solutions and minimize traveler impacts. Maintenance also worked with other state agencies to control noxious weeds in WYDOT rights of way and plant living snow fences to improve safety during winter months. Additionally, the Environmental Services Section coordinated with both federal and state agencies—such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD), Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, and others—to address environmental concerns and obtain permits. Environmental Services successfully coordinated the FHWA programmatic agreement update regarding the processing of actions classified as categorical exclusions for federal-aid highway projects as well as a new programmatic agreement with the State Historic Preservation Office. Agency partnerships like these help tackle larger projects as well. For example, Environmental Services coordinated with district staff and WGFD to evaluate wildlife crossing features for the upcoming Halleck Ridge and US 189 wildlife crossings.\n\n### Elected Officials\n\nWYDOT stays engaged with elected officials to educate policy makers on issues, solutions, and opportunities regarding the state's transportation system. As part of state legislative activities in 2023, Management Services worked with programs and executives to create educational interim materials, analyze legislation for WYDOT impacts, and track bills throughout the session. One of the more notable legislative issues that WYDOT worked during the interim was updating statutory requirements for color photos on Wyoming driver's licenses and IDs to improve quality and security credentials. The Driver Services Program provided key testimony to the Joint Transportation Committee, which resulted in successful legislation. Driver Services began issuing the new, more secure, credentials in November 2023. Management Services also kept in consistent contact with the Governor's office and Congressional staff to inform them about WYDOT policy stances and IIJA implementation challenges and opportunities, including Build America/Buy America, discretionary grant rural exceptions, and truck parking. These efforts resulted in impactful policy changes at the federal level that improve WYDOT operations.\n\n## INDUSTRY AND OTHER NON-GOVERNMENT ENTITIES\n\nWYDOT relies heavily on its relationships with industry partners and non-government stakeholders. The Construction Program's work with the Wyoming Associated General Contractors (Wyoming AGC) is a great example of how WYDOT forges industry relationships to improve our transportation system. Construction held joint 2023 WYDOT/AGC meetings to cover topics such as cover structures, drilled shafts, and construction collaboration that address industry and agency priorities. Significantly, 2023 saw WYDOT and AGC develop and conduct the first round of construction collaboration training for field and contractor personnel. This milestone helped move the collaboration training to full implementation on all projects. The Civil Rights Program also collaborated with the Wyoming AGC to train and educate their members on the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program. Additionally, WYDOT partners with higher education as demonstrated in Environmental Services' partnership with the University of Montana to begin wildlife monitoring assessment for the second phase of the Jackson South project.\n\nWYDOT is also an active participant with the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Representatives from the Highway Development Program are active on AASHTO's Technical Committee on Roadside Safety, and in 2023 personnel authored Chapter 9, Semi-rigid Barriers, of the revised Roadside Design Guide. The Management Services team also represents WYDOT on AASHTO's Transportation Policy Forum, providing a rural perspective to national transportation policy issues.\n\nPAGE 36\n",

To maximize public benefit while living within funding constraints, WYDOT uses audits and innovation to ensure efficient and effective service.\n\n## AUDITS\n\nWYDOT and its various programs participate in audits to ensure we responsibly manage our resources and administer our functions. WYDOT's Internal Review Services Program is integral to auditing WYDOT resources and operations. For instance, Internal Review Services reviews consultant services costs to determine if rates are reasonable for WYDOT projects, completing 29 such reviews in FY23. Internal Review Services also uses a risk-based approach to evaluate pass-through funds to subrecipients and reviews compliance audits for any findings related to WYDOT funds—ultimately issuing a management decision per 2 CFR 200. Perhaps most notably, Internal Review Services performs a cash funds audit to ensure the appropriate use of WYDOT funds according to policy. For the FY22 Single Audit, WYDOT received an unmodified opinion and zero findings for federal awards.\n\nWYDOT programs have passed many audits with no findings. In FY23, the Financial Services Program received an unmodified audit opinion on its financial statements, and MVS received no findings from an IFTA peer review audit on IFTA licensing and tax return reporting. When auditing WYDOT operations, findings show WYDOT's efficiencies and effectiveness. In FY23, Internal Review Services reviewed traffic striping rates, for example, with the results clearly demonstrating the effectiveness and quality of WYDOT performance in this area.\n\n## RESEARCH\n\nWYDOT participates in research initiatives to further innovate and advance WYDOT operations. A vital piece of WYDOT's research efforts stem from the Research Advisory Committee (RAC), which distributed about $1.6 million to seven research projects in 2023. The RAC prioritizes projects on how they address issues affecting operations of WYDOT, stakeholders, and Wyoming highways as well as how they will advance techniques, materials, or specifications from a financial, operational, environmental, or social viewpoint. WYDOT's Research Center also provides financial support for WYDOT's participation in several national organizations, including the Transportation Research Board (TRB), Product Evaluation and Audit Solutions Program, and National Cooperative Highway Research Program. On a local level, the Research Center distributes funds to the Local Transportation Assistance Program, which the University of Wyoming administers.\n\nNotable research work in 2023 included the Materials Program's participation in the FHWA Midwest States Balanced Mix Design Peer Exchange. Balanced mix design incorporates performance testing into the mix design process to predict multiple distress modes occurring because of mix aging, traffic, climate, and location within the pavement structure. The balanced mix design implementation will\n\nPAGE 38\n",

Additionally, the Highway Development Program oversaw research to develop approach guardrail transitions for both MGS and box beam guardrail to the new bridge rail and a box beam transition to various concrete barrier shapes. Texas A&M performed this research and is trying to obtain FHWA eligibility letters to deploy the new transitions. Highway Development also solicited a proposal from the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility in Lincoln, Nebraska, to develop median barrier hardware for box beam guardrail, which was selected by the RAC for funding. These ongoing research efforts and collaborations will keep WYDOT ready for the future of transportation safety and performance.\n\n*District 5 pavement work in Buffalo Valley*\n\n## EFFICIENCIES BY DIVSION\n\nThough this entire report provides many examples of WYDOT's efficiencies, the following lists additional accomplishments in FY23 regarding innovation and efficiency benefitting Wyoming.\n\n### Aeronautics\n\n» Air Service Development saw the CPA deliver more passengers through Wyoming airports while reducing the cost per passenger.\n\n» Engineering and Construction administered $3.87 million in group pavement maintenance projects resulting in about $810,000 in cost savings from economies of scale.\n\n» Flight Operations operated and maintained its own hangar facility, located at the Cheyenne Regional Airport, including a fuel farm that enables the program to buy fuel at wholesale cost, saving $133,000 in fuel expenses.\n\n» Flight Operations' pilots work with Air Traffic Control to fly the most efficient and direct flight routes for additional cost savings.\n\n### Engineering and Planning\n\n» Bridge finalized a simple span bridge design using pre-stressed, pre-cast slab sections that are post-tensioned transversely to accelerate bridge construction and reduce traffic disruptions.\n\n» C&E continued working with a developer to improve web-based bidding software, reducing the time to produce reports while increasing accuracy.\n\n» Program Performance implemented monthly updates to all changes made to projects, and reassigned projects to project managers to bolster efficiency.\n\nPAGE 39\n",

ROW also oversaw 67 leases of various kinds, paying rent on 42 while the remaining 25 WYDOT-owned properties generated just under $273,000 in income.\n\n## Operations\n\n» District 1's Curtis Street bridge replacement used innovative contracting to minimize the closure and impact to area businesses.\n\n» District 2 Equipment forces performed critical work on the hot mix production plant to increase its efficient operation for the many districts who use it for paving in remote locations.\n\n## Technology\n\n» Emergency Communications emphasized safety and technician training that enabled more tasks to be completed with in-house resources.\n\n» IT enhanced and updated their automation tool (Ivanti LanDesk) to streamline installations and upgrades to software, operating systems, and security patching and to save technicians time in initial system imaging and software deployment.\n\n» IT implemented a process to generate audit detail reporting for payroll and labor transactions and developed prototypes for alternative fuel return formats for Fuel Tax Administration in anticipation of legislative changes.\n\n## Support Services\n\n» Driver Services worked with IT to launch the virtual lobby in several locations that included an update on Driver Services' website allowing customers to virtually sign up in select locations and \"get in line\" without coming to the exam station. The virtual lobby reduces in-person wait times and allows staff to better manage workflows.\n\n» The dedication of Employee Safety and other WYDOT teams to safety training lowered WYDOT's monthly premium paid to Worker's Compensation. As part of this effort, the Employee Safety Partnership Visit Program joined with the Workers' Compensation Risk Management Program to conduct site inspections, saving $19,800 a month.\n\n» Mailing Services Section saved WYDOT $3,126 by presorting mail.\n\n*Plowing Dayton Gulch*\n\nPAGE 40\n",

The program assisted other agencies with vehicle-related issues, responded to complaints from vehicle industry victims, and investigated VIN and title fraud. Notably, program personnel investigated several cases of online fraud scams where perpetrators convincingly represented themselves as currently licensed dealers and offered vehicles for sale online, then required monetary deposits to be sent to fictitious locations or bank accounts, with no intention of delivering any vehicle.\n\n**MANAGEMENT SERVICES** coordinated with surrounding states to advance rural state policy priorities and respond to federal comment periods regarding Build America/Buy America waiver extensions, greenhouse gas emissions, and other IIJA implementation topics. The program represented WYDOT on the Statewide Nuclear Working Group and AASHTO's TPF. The program published six internal policies and worked on several rule promulgations, including the Wildlife Conservation Plates and Driver's Licenses rules.\n\n**INTERNAL REVIEW** provided critical information to decision makers to mitigate risk and ensure compliance and maintain good stewardship of resources. The program reviewed consultant services costs to determine if the rate is reasonable for WYDOT projects as a way to manage resources.\n\n**CIVIL RIGHTS** provided policy development and guidance on Title VI, Prevailing Wage, ADA, internal and external Equal Employment Opportunity requirements, the DBE Program, and the Federal Contractor Compliance Program. **Total DBE participation** for this reporting year was **5.29 percent with two new DBEs certified**. The program also posted all of the pertinent federal-aid posters on the WYDOT website to help the contracting industry. Website updates and information concerning poster updates has been reiterated at subsequent meetings with contractors.\n\nPAGE 41\n",

        "text": "Definitions and Terms 101.2.1\nSECTION 101\nDefinitions and Terms\n101.1 Active Voice and Imperative Mood\n1 The Wyoming Department of Transportation has rewritten this edition of\nStandard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction with an emphasis\non the active voice. In a sentence written in the active voice, someone acts on\nsomething. For example: “The engineer will take a sample.” A similar sentence\nin the passive voice—“A sample will be taken”—would be unclear about who\nwas responsible for taking the sample.\n2 This edition of Standard Specifications also makes use of the imperative\nmood. The imperative mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and\nthe party receiving it are already understood. In Standard Specifications, the\ndepartment is stating its requirements or directions for work to the contractor;\nsuch statements have the same force as if they contained the word “shall.” In an\nimperative sentence such as, “Pour the concrete,” the department is indicating\nthat it requires the contractor to pour the concrete. Before the award of a\ncontract, imperative statements are directed to the bidder. After a contract has\nbeen awarded, imperatives are directed to the contractor.\n3 The department will identify parties other than the bidder or contractor to whom\nit gives a responsibility in Standard Specifications. In phrasings where the\nresponsible party has already been clearly identified or in factual statements\nwhen it is not important to do so, the department may use the passive voice.\n101.2 Organization of Specifications\n101.2.1 General\n1 With the exception of Division 100, General Provisions, Division 800, Materials,\nand Section 701, Electrical Devices, the sections of Standard Specifications\nare written in a five-part format. Each section contains the following primary\nsubsections:\nXXX.1 Description\nXXX.2 Materials\nXXX.3 Equipment\nXXX.4 Construction\nXXX.5 Measurement and Payment\n2",

For example, the equipment portion\nof Section 401, Plant Mix Pavements and Recycled Plant Mix Pavements,\nincludes the following:\n401.3 Equipment\n401.3.1 Milling\n401.3.2 Crushing\n401.3.3 Mixing Plant\n401.3.3.1 General\n1.

Subsection 401.3.3,\n401.3.3.2 Batch Plants Mixing Plant\n401.3.3.3 Drum Plants\n401.3.4 Hauling Equipment\n101.2.2 Hierarchy of Organization\n1 The requirements of a subsection apply to subordinate subsections. In\naddition, and as shown at Subsection 401.3.3, Mixing Plant, in the example,\nmany subsections begin with a lower-level subsection called “General.” The\nrequirements of “General” subsections apply to the associated same-level\nsubsections that follow. For example, the requirements of Subsection 401.3.3.1,\nMixing Plant, General, (which includes requirements about cold feed control\nand control units), apply to Subsections 401.3.3.2, Batch Plants, and 401.3.3.3,\nDrum Plants. They do not apply to the higher-level Subsection 401.3.4, Hauling\nEquipment.\n101.2.3 Titles (or Headings) and References\n1 The titles or headings of sections and subsections are for convenience and do\nnot bear on the meaning of the text.\n2 Technical specifications and other documents referenced in the contract refers\nto the edition in effect at the time of award of the contract, unless otherwise\nspecified.\n3",

Nor will the engineer grant an extension based on pleas that\nthe contract specified insufficient time for the completion of the project.\n4 The granting of a time extension by the engineer relieves the contractor from\nliability for the payment of liquidated damages during the period of the extension.\n108.6.2 Excusable Delays\n1 Excusable delays are delays affecting working days that the contractor cannot\nreasonably foresee or avoid and are not the contractor’s fault or responsibility.\nThey include but are not limited to the following:\n1. Delays due to floods, tornadoes, lightning strikes, earthquakes, fires,\nepidemics, or similar natural phenomena;\n2. Weather delays as specified in Subsection 108.6.6, Working Day\nExtensions for Adverse Weather;\n98",

Notify the subcontractor\nof this action in writing.\n3 Within 14 calendar days, upon completion of a subcontractor’s work and after\nhe or she has met the requirements of the subcontractor agreement with the\nprime contractor, pay the full amount due, including retainage.\n4 Submit a final Form E-139 to the department for all subcontractors.\n109.5.3 Contractor-Subcontractor Disputes\n1 If an issue involving payment by the contractor to a subcontractor becomes the\nsubject of dispute, the party (contractor or subcontractor) raising the dispute is\nresponsible for promptly submitting a written description of the dispute to the\nengineer. State clearly who the dispute is between, the reason for the dispute,\nthe dollar amount involved, and other pertinent information.\n2 Upon receipt of the written notice, the engineer will withhold the amount in dispute\nfrom the next monthly progress payment. The contractor and subcontractor are\nresponsible for settling their dispute. Upon written notification to the engineer\nthat the dispute is settled, signed by all parties involved in the dispute, the\ndepartment will pay the disputed amount in the next monthly progress payment.\n3 If the contractor and the subcontractor fail to resolve the dispute, the department\nwill consider both parties in default of the contract. The department may deny\nthe parties future bid envelopes, in accordance with Subsection 102.3, Bid\nEnvelope and Electronic Bid System Device, and it may not approve their\nperformance of future subcontract work, in accordance with Subsection 108.1,\nSubletting of Contract.\n123",

Borrow Special Excavation is a pit-run, granular material taken from\nspecified material sources.\n2. Muck Excavation consists of the removal and disposal of saturated\nsoils or saturated mixtures of soils and organic matter from within\nthe construction limits but not associated with culvert installations.\nSoils or mixtures of soils will be classified as muck excavation only\nif they cannot be excavated using the same equipment and procedure\nas used for unclassified excavation.\nClassification and removal of unsuitable materials associated with\nculvert installations is specified in Section 206, Excavation and Backfill\nfor Culverts.\n3. Rock Excavation consists of the removal and disposal of igneous,\nmetamorphic, or sedimentary rock, which cannot be excavated without\nblasting or the use of conventional excavating equipment. The limits\nof rock excavation are based on seismic velocities as defined in the\ncontract and the structural characteristics of the bedrock. Excavation\noutside these limits is unclassified excavation as defined below.\n4. Unclassified Excavation consists of the excavation and placement or\ndisposal of materials encountered in the work, including excavation\nfrom material sources, not classified under other contract pay items.\n203.2 MATERIALS—Vacant\n203.3 EQUIPMENT—Vacant\n164",

If the material at grade\ncan be finished and compacted, excavation below grade will not be required.\nObtain material for backfilling to subgrade from other grading areas. Dispose\nof unsuitable material at a specified waste site or incorporate into other portions\nof the work, as approved by the engineer.\n8 Give five working days advance notice before beginning excavation in any\nborrow source. Do not remove material before cross-sectioning or digital terrain\nmodeling of the site by the engineer.\n9 Sequence roadway construction and excavation from borrow sources to minimize\nthe waste of material.

The\ndepartment will consider third-party testing if the contractor provides certified\ntest data from the supplier that differs statistically from department test results.\nFor this purpose, “statistically different” results are those greater than the\ndifference between the specification value and the value in the row for Pay\nFactor = 1.00 in Table 401.5.3-1, PGAB Pay Factors. If third-party testing is\njustified, select the laboratory jointly with the engineer; the department will only\nconsider results for the property in question and will consider as binding only\nthose results that differ statistically from its own—in which case it will use the\nthird-party results to recalculate the pay factor in accordance with Subsection\n401.5.3.2, Performance Graded Asphalt Binder. If the recalculation produces\nan increase in the pay factor, the department will pay for the testing; otherwise,\nthe contractor will pay for the testing.\n401.4.7.3 Plant Mix\n1 The contractor is responsible for quality acceptance testing as required by Table\n401.4.12-1, Testing Requirements, and Table 401.4.12-2, In-Place Density\nTest Requirements, for the level of control specified. Before using contractor\ntest results for quality acceptance, the department will perform procedures for\ncorrelation as described in Section 114, Laboratories, Personnel, and Correlation.\n2 Perform quality acceptance testing using the following procedure:\n1. Aggregate Gradation. Collect two samples. Test one sample for\nquality acceptance and the engineer may test the other sample for\nverification.\n2. In-Place Density. Collect two cores at each location designated by\nthe engineer. Test one sample for quality acceptance and the engineer\nmay test the other sample for verification.\n3. Mix Volumetrics. Testing for mix volumetrics may be completed\noff-site at an AASHTO-accredited laboratory using the department\nprocedure for reheated samples in accordance with the Materials\nTesting Manual. If a mobile field lab is used, ensure that it is properly\nequipped to perform the required testing.

Offset the longitudinal\nconstruction joint in subsequent layers of plant mix 6 in [150 mm] and stagger\nso that no two coincide. Place longitudinal construction joints within 6 in\n[150 mm] of the specified lane line(s).\n9 Form transverse joints by cutting back on the previous run of plant mix to expose\nthe full depth of the course.\n10 Before placing additional plant mix, apply tack coat material in accordance with\nSection 407, Tack Coat, to join contact surfaces.\n11 In areas where irregularities or obstacles make the use of mechanical spreading\nand finishing equipment impractical, place the material to produce a uniform\nsurface finish and the required compacted thickness without tearing, shoving,\ngouging, or segregating.\n12 When constructing pavements thicker than 1 in [25 mm] under traffic, do not\nleave a longitudinal exposed vertical drop-off between adjacent travel lanes at\nday’s end. A continuous, integral taper with a slope no greater than 1V:3H may\nbe constructed the entire length of the face of the exposed longitudinal joint\nbetween adjacent travel lanes.

Provide rollers of sufficient number, weight, and types to obtain the\nrequired compaction without displacement, cracking, or shoving; operate with\nthe drive wheels or drums nearest the paver. Do not use equipment that results\nin excessive crushing of the aggregate, and do not operate or park rollers in a\nmanner that adversely affects the surface of the pavement.\n2 When placing plant mix against previously placed material, begin rolling at the\njoint, then follow the pattern established from the test strip. On super-elevated\ncurves, begin rolling at the low side and progress to the high side using overlapping\nlongitudinal passes parallel to the centerline.\n3 Along forms, curbs, headers, walls, and other areas not accessible to the rollers,\ncompact plant mix with hot hand or mechanical tampers.

Aggregate lots that meet or exceed a pay factor level of\n0.75 are acceptable for incorporation into the project at the pay factor calculated\nin accordance with Subsection 409.5.2, Determination of Pay Factors.\n2 Lot size is defined by the department as the number of square yards [square\nmeters] placed, represented by five tests as shown in Table 409.4.4-1, Chip\nSeal Test Requirements. A sublot is the quantity represented by one test. The\nengineer will determine the exact lot size, which may vary due to project length,\nproduction suspension, construction schedules, material source changes, or\nother acceptable reasons. Except in unusual situations, the engineer will use\nlots consisting of five samples. When necessary due to production, project size,\nmaterial source changes, or suspension, lots of from three to seven samples\nmay be used. Partial lots with less than three samples will be included with\nthe previous lot for analysis. Lot size will be controlled by the project size or\nchanges in the material source and may span several days of production.\n3 Obtain aggregate gradation samples in accordance with Subsection 800.2 (3),\nPoint of Sampling, and the Materials Testing Manual at random locations\ndetermined by the engineer and in the presence of the engineer.\n409.4.4.4 Test Section\n1 Before full production, construct a test section 0.5 mi [0.8 km] long or less as\napproved by the engineer for each type of surface upon which the chip seal is\nto be placed to establish the following:\n1.

Remove existing maintenance patches to original repair depth\nor deeper, as required to remove unsound concrete. Do not operate jackhammers\nor mechanical chipping tools at an angle in excess of 45 degrees, measured from\nthe slab surface. Use hand tools to remove final particles of unsound concrete\nor achieve the required depth. Work so that saw slurry drains from, and stays\naway from, areas cleared of unsound concrete.\n2 When resurfacing is specified, ensure that new concrete above the prepared\nsurface or existing reinforcing steel is at least 1.0 in [25 mm] thick. Check\nthe clearance before placing concrete. Attach a filler block to the bottom of a\nfinishing device, and pass the finishing machine over the area to be finished on\nscreed rails. Remove concrete and depress and tie down reinforcing steel that\nobstructs the filler block. If necessary, remove concrete beneath reinforcement\nto enable adequate depression. When placing new concrete, keep at least : in\n[19 mm] of clear distance around these bars.\n551",

        "text": "SECTION 101\nDefinitions and Terms\n101.1 Active Voice and Imperative Mood\n1 The Wyoming Department of Transportation has rewritten this edition of Standard\nSpecifications for Road and Bridge Construction with an emphasis on the active voice.\nIn a sentence written in the active voice, someone acts on something. For example: “The\nengineer will take a sample.” A similar sentence in the passive voice—“A sample will be\ntaken”—would be unclear about who was responsible for taking the sample.\n2 This edition of Standard Specifications also makes use of the imperative mood. The\nimperative mood is used when the party issuing an instruction and the party receiving it\nare already understood. In Standard Specifications, the department is stating its\nrequirements or directions for work to the contractor; such statements have the same force\nas if they contained the word “shall.” In an imperative sentence such as, “Pour the\nconcrete,” the department is indicating that it requires the contractor to pour the concrete.\nBefore the award of a contract, imperative statements are directed to the bidder. After a\ncontract has been awarded, imperatives are directed to the contractor.\n3 The department will identify parties other than the bidder or contractor to whom it gives a\nresponsibility in Standard Specifications. In phrasings where the responsible party has\nalready been clearly identified or in factual statements when it is not important to do so,\nthe department may use the passive voice.\n101.2 Organization of Specifications\n101.2.1 General\n1 With the exception of Division 100, General Provisions, Division 800, Materials, and Section\n701, Electrical Devices, the sections of Standard Specifications are written in a five-part\nformat. Each section contains the following primary subsections:\nXXX.1 Description\nXXX.2 Materials\nXXX.3 Equipment\nXXX.4 Construction\nXXX.5 Measurement and Payment\n2",

        "text": "Definitions and Terms SECTION 101\n2 The subsections contain varying numbers of titled sub-subsections composed of higher\nand lower levels, as in an outline. For example, the equipment portion of Section 401, Plant\nMix Pavements and Recycled Plant Mix Pavements, includes the following:\n401.3 Equipment\n401.3.1 Milling\n401.3.2 Crushing\n401.3.3 Mixing Plant\n401.3.3.1 General\n1. Cold feed control system lower levels of\n2. Control Unit… subsection 401.3.3,\n401.3.3.2 Batch Plants Mixing Plant\n401.3.3.3 Drum Plants\n401.3.4 Hauling Equipment\n101.2.2 Hierarchy of Organization\n1 The requirements of a subsection apply to subordinate subsections. In addition, and as\nshown at Subsection 401.3.3, Mixing Plant, in the example, many subsections begin with\na lower-level subsection called “General.” The requirements of “General” subsections\napply to the associated same-level subsections that follow. For example, the requirements\nof Subsection 401.3.3.1, Mixing Plant, General, (which includes requirements about cold\nfeed control and control units), apply to Subsections 401.3.3.2, Batch Plants, and\n401.3.3.3, Drum Plants. They do not apply to the higher-level Subsection 401.3.4, Hauling\nEquipment.\n101.2.3 Titles (or Headings) and References\n1 The titles or headings of sections and subsections are for convenience and do not bear\non the meaning of the text.\n2 Technical specifications and other documents referenced in the contract refers to the\nedition in effect at the time of award of the contract, unless otherwise specified.\n101.3 Measurement Units: Inch-Pound (U.S. Customary) Versus International\nSystem (SI or Metric)\n1 Standard Specifications shows sizes and measurements in both inch-pound (U.S.\nCustomary) and International (SI or Metric) System units. Inch-pound units appear first,\nfollowed by a metric counterpart inside square brackets “[ ].”\n2 When reading Standard Specifications, use the system of measurements used by the\ndepartment for the bid items on its “Proposal” (Form E-91). Do not mathematically convert\nthe units from one system of measure to another; the department does not intend its\nmeasurement values to be equivalent and does not consider values interchangeable.\n3",

When constructing pavements thicker than 1\nin [25 mm] under traffic, schedule the work in accordance with Subsection 401.4.19,\nSpreading and Finishing. Do not taper temporary pavement ends more steeply than\n1V:6H.\n2 Use temporary traffic control or safety devices to delineate drop-offs, unless otherwise\ndirected. The provision, maintenance, and removal of temporary controls and tapers is\nincidental to associated pay items in the contract.\n107.12 Responsibility for Safeguarding the Work\n1 The contractor’s responsibility for the work lasts until final written acceptance of the project\nby the district engineer, in accordance with Subsection 113.4, Final Acceptance, and\nincludes protection against injury or damage to any part of the project from any cause.\nExcept for damage due to unforeseeable causes beyond the control of and without the\nfault or negligence of the contractor, rebuild, repair, restore, and make good damages to\nany portion of the project from any cause before final acceptance and without additional\ncost to the department. Suspension of the work does not relieve the contractor of\nresponsibility for the project, except in accordance with Subsection 108.5, Suspension of\nWork.\n107.13 Responsibility for Utility Procedures and Services\n107.13.1 Location\n1 The department makes every effort to indicate the location of utility and pipeline facilities\nin the contract and to notify utility companies of impending construction. Before proceeding\nwith the work, confirm the final grade and locations of such facilities in accordance with\nW.S. 37-12-301 et sequens (the “Wyoming Underground Facilities Notification Act”) and\nW.S. 37-3-301 et sequens (the “Wyoming High Voltage Power Lines and Safety\nRestrictions Act”).\n2\nNotify utility and pipeline companies of the proposed construction schedule at least three\nworking days before the start of work. Ask for the nature, location, and depth of pipes\nand cables and the areas where they may conflict with the work. If a company cannot or\nwill not provide this information, obtain it by alternate means. Where conflicts may exist,\nlocate the relevant pipes or cables in three dimensions. Do not begin excavation until all\nsuch features have been located, their owners notified, and the engineer has approved.\nDo not start work near fire hydrants or gas regulators without arranging continued service.\n72",

Use the following procedures:\n1. The engineer will mark seven randomly selected locations using a table of random\nnumbers with exclusion of locations within 12 in [300 mm] of the pavement edge.\n2. Take one pair of core samples from each sample location, in the presence of the\nengineer.\n3. The department and the contractor will dry the cores to constant weight [mass]\nusing a nondestructive method.\n4. Test one sample from each of the seven pairs of dry cores for bulk specific gravity\nand density; do so independent of the department.\n5. The engineer will test the other sample from each of the seven pairs of dry cores\nindependent of the contractor.\n6. The engineer will perform the statistical evaluation after the seven pairs of tests\nhave been completed.\n114.3.4 Resolving Field Testing Discrepancies\n1 Resolve discrepancies as follows:\n1. Meet with department personnel and review testing procedures, equipment\ncondition, and equipment calibrations in attempt to solve the problem.\n2. When cause of the discrepancy has been identified and corrected, repeat the\ncorrelation procedure.\n3. If the second correlation determines that the contractor’s and department’s test\nresults represent different sample populations, conduct referee testing.\n4. The Materials Program will conduct the referee tests using the retained referee\nsamples for aggregate gradations and the department’s cores for density testing.\n5. The Materials Program will make its results available within five working days of\nreceiving the samples.\n6. If the samples represent a quality acceptance lot, the engineer will use test results\ncorrelating with the Materials Program test results for the quality acceptance\ncalculations.\n126",

Borrow Special Excavation is a pit-run, granular material taken from specified\nmaterial sources.\n2. Muck Excavation consists of the removal and disposal of saturated soils or\nsaturated mixtures of soils and organic matter from within the construction limits\nbut not associated with culvert installations. Soils or mixtures of soils will be\nclassified as muck excavation only if they cannot be excavated using the same\nequipment and procedure as used for unclassified excavation.\nClassification and removal of unsuitable materials associated with culvert\ninstallations is specified in Section 206, Excavation and Backfill for Culverts.\n3. Rock Excavation consists of the removal and disposal of igneous, metamorphic,\nor sedimentary rock, which cannot be excavated without blasting or the use of\nconventional excavating equipment.

Alternatively, the engineer may allow sloping of the trench walls above the top\nof the pipe being installed.\n3 Excavate for manholes, inlet or outlet structures, and other structures associated with\nvarious types of conduit in the same manner as for conduit maintaining minimum\nclearances outside of each footing or wall as shown in the contract.\n206.4.1.3 Culvert / Trench Subexcavation\n1 The engineer may require additional excavation when unsuitable foundation conditions\nare encountered at the bottom of a channel or trench or when it is impractical to excavate\nto the established grade.\n2 Excavation below the grade required to install pipe bed course material in the\nbedding limits, or the bottom of box culverts or other structures where no bedding\nis required will be classified as culvert subexcavation.\n206.4.2 Disposal of Excavated Materials\n1 Dispose of excavated material by one of the following methods:\n1. Stockpile for use as backfill.\n2. Incorporate into other portions of the work.\n3. Handle as waste.\n2 Do not stockpile material for backfilling so that it interferes with construction or channel\ndrainage. Transport excess material suitable for embankment construction to specified\nsites or as approved by the engineer. Waste and dispose of material unsuitable for use\nelsewhere on fill slopes or at specified locations. Do not place waste material next to a\nchannel or on flood plain where flood waters can wash the material into a channel.\n206.4.3 Protection of Structures\n1 Protect excavations from saturation or erosion, and dewater sites where standing or\nrunning water would interfere with proper installation of the structure or pipes.\n150",

Fill with class B concrete to the specified elevation for the bottom of the\nfooting.\n212.4.3 Preparation of Foundations for Footings\n1 When excavations for footings are in rock or other hard foundation material, cut the\nfinal surface level and remove loose debris. Clean seams and fill with concrete, mortar,\nor grout.\n2 When placing concrete on an excavated surface other than rock, avoid disturbing the\nbottom of the excavation. Place concrete immediately after removal of foundation\nmaterial to grade.\n212.4.4 Cofferdams\n1 Construct cofferdams to protect fresh concrete against damage from a sudden rising of\nthe stream and to prevent damage to the foundation by erosion. When required, provide\ncofferdams, as water tight as possible, designed to safely satisfy the requirements of the\nsite and construction. Construct earthen cofferdams using clean material from sources\nother than surface water sources.

If all the\ntests meet the acceptance criteria (i.e. anchors do not pull out after holding the maximum\nload for 5 minutes), then no more testing is required. If any anchor pulls out, then test an\nadditional 10 percent of the remaining anchors. If any additional anchors pull out, test an\nadditional 10 percent of the remaining anchors. The engineer will designate pullout test\nlocations. Replace and retest failed anchors at no additional cost to the department.\n7 In the event soil materials or pullout testing indicates that the subsurface materials or\nconstruction methods are not providing adequate bond for the anchors, the engineer may\nrequire additional testing.\n219.4.3 Acceptance\n1 The engineer will consider pullout tested grouted anchors acceptable when the\nmaximum test load is successfully held for a minimum of 5 minutes with minor jacking of\nthe pump and with minimal distress and deflection of the anchor and testing system.\n2 The engineer will consider pullout tested grouted anchors rejected when a pullout failure\noccurs prior to or at the maximum test load. Pullout failure is defined as the continued\npullout movement of the test anchor or loss of pressure on the jacking ram at or below\nthe maximum test load. Record the pullout failure load as part of the test data. Replace\nall failed anchors at no additional cost to the department, unless otherwise directed by the\nengineer. If the engineer determines that the test setup is invalid, one attempt may be\nmade to reset the system or propose a modified test system for approval, at no additional\ncost to the department.\n219.5 MEASUREMENT and PAYMENT\n1 The engineer will measure:\n1. Driven Anchors and Grouted Anchors by the each [Ea] installed and accepted.\n2. Rockfall Mesh by the square yard [square meter] of exposed surface area with no\nallowance for overlaps. Wire bearing rope, clamps, lacing wire, and locking clips\nwill not be measured separately, but are considered subsidiary to the pay item\nRockfall Mesh.\n209",

Do not allow traffic to pass through the\nwork zone while scaling. Protect the pavement with blast mats or other protective\nsystems. Repair damaged pavement at no additional cost to the department. Clear the\nroadway and ditches of rock, and load, haul, and dispose of rock debris to a specified\nlocation.\n3 Manually scale unstable rock that cannot be removed by machine.\n4 During manual scaling, provide a crew on the slope that consists at all times of a\nworking foreman and two scalers. Immediately replace with a foreman or scaler any crew\nmember who leaves. Light mechanical means, such as hydraulic jacks or splitters, may be\nused to remove unstable rock that cannot be removed by conventional manual methods.\n5 Following completion of scaling operations of a slope, the engineer will inspect the slope\nand determine if scaling is complete. If additional rocks are identified as being\nhazardous, continue to scale the slope until the scaling has been completed to the\nsatisfaction of the engineer.\n220.5 MEASUREMENT and PAYMENT\n1 The engineer will measure:\n1. Scaling (Machine) by the actual hours the equipment is used for scaling.\n2. Scaling (Manual) by the crew-hour, with a crew defined as a working foreman and\ntwo scalers clipped into ropes and on the slope. Standby time while the road is\ncleared of debris and traffic passing through the work zone will be at the manual\nscaling rate. If there are more than two scalers on the slope, the CRWH will be\nprorated based on the number of scalers over the standard crew.\n2 Setup or breakdown time of personnel and equipment for either scaling pay item will\nnot be measured directly for payment. Hand (manual) scaling from a man lift or another\npiece of equipment will be paid for as Scaling (Manual).\n3 Temporary rockfall barrier will not be measured or paid for separately, but will be\nconsidered subsidiary to the scaling bid items.\n212",

Avoid\ndelays that could impair retention of the aggregate.\n2. Chip Seal Aggregate immediately after the application of emulsified asphalt,\nspread and seat the cover coat aggregate. Spread the material without operating\nthe equipment’s tires on the exposed, newly applied emulsified asphalt.\nImmediately after spreading, cover deficient areas with additional material.\n2 After the emulsion used to seal the road and bond the aggregate has cured, thoroughly\nbroom the entire surface. Remove excess aggregate. Do not remove imbedded\naggregate.\n3 When specified, apply an overshoot after placing the chip seal coat. Emulsified asphalt\nused for overshoot may be diluted in the field at a ratio of 1 part emulsified asphalt to 1\npart water (1:1). Before mixing, heat the dilution water and emulsified asphalt to a\nminimum temperature specified by the supplier. Dilute by introducing the water into the\nemulsified asphalt. When using a rapid set emulsion for the overshoot, have it diluted by\nthe emulsified asphalt supplier at its facility. Apply at a temperature range in accordance\nwith Table 409.4.3-1, Emulsion Application Temperatures for Chip and Fog Seals.\nOvershoot the chip seal at the rate established during the test section production. Do not\nallow traffic on the surface until the overshoot has sufficiently cured to prevent picking up\nor tracking. Cover excess quantities with blotter material.\n409.4.4.6 Opening to Traffic\n1 Open roadways as follows:\n1. Chip Seal. Do not allow unrestricted traffic on the chip sealed surface before\nremoving excess cover coat aggregate. If placing traffic on the chip seal before\nthe removal of excess flyrock, pilot the traffic through the work at 30 mph [50 km/h]\nor less. Apply blotter, as directed by the engineer, to areas where emulsion is\n'bleeding through' to prevent tracking/adhering to vehicle tires. Open the roadway\n309",

During heating, place\nintermediate safety catch blocks at the midlength of the girder within 2 in [50 mm]\nof the flanges.\n4. Curve beams and girders by continuous or V-type heating. Heat those flange\nedges that will be on the inside of the horizontal curve after cooling. Heat both\ninside and outside flange surfaces when the flange thickness equals or exceeds 1¼\nin [31 mm]; heat both surfaces concurrently.\n4.1 For the continuous method, heat a strip along the edge of the top and\nbottom flange simultaneously; ensure sufficient strip width and temperature\nto obtain specified curvature.\n4.2 For V-type heating, heat the top and bottom flanges at approximately the\nsame rate and in regularly spaced truncated triangular areas having their\nbase along the flange edge. On the inside flange surface, end the apex of\nthe truncated triangular area just before the juncture of the web and flange.\nWhen the radius of curvature is 1000 ft [300 m] or more, extend the apex of\nthe truncated triangular heating pattern applied to the outside flange surface\nto the juncture of the flange and web. When the radius of curvature is less\nthan 1000 ft [300 m], extend the apex of the truncated triangular heating\npattern of the outside flange surface past the web for a distance equal to\none-eighth of the flange width or 3 in [75 mm], whichever is less. Use a\ntruncated triangular pattern with an included angle of approximately 15 to\n30 degrees and a base no greater than 10 in [250 mm]. The department’s\ninspector may approve varying patterns.\n5. Measure final horizontal curvature and vertical camber after welding and heating\nare complete and flanges have cooled to a uniform temperature. Check horizontal\ncurvature with the girder in the vertical position by measuring offsets from a\nstringline or wire attached to both flanges or other method approved by the\ndepartment’s inspector. Check camber with the girder in the horizontal position.\n501.4.1.9 Finish\n1 Ensure that shearing, thermal-cutting, and chipping of plates leaves edges smooth and free\nof discontinuities. Break, flatten, or round by grinding all sheared or thermal cut edges\nand corners that will be exposed in finished members to be painted.\n388",

Snug-tighten from the center of the connection to the free edges, then\nretighten in a similar systematic manner, as necessary, until all fasteners are\nsimultaneously snug-tight and all plies of the connection are in full contact.\n2 After snug-tightening, tighten fasteners in the connection to achieve the minimum tension\nshown in Table 501.4.2-2, Bolt Tension. Progress systematically from the center of the\njoint to its free edges.\n501.4.2.3.4.6 Direct Tension Indicating Washer Installation\n1 Direct tension indicating washers may be used to ensure proper bolt tension, as specified\nin Table 501.4.2-2, Bolt Tension. Place the direct tension indicating washer on the bolt\nwith the protrusions bearing against the underside of the bolt head; turn the nut. If the bolt\nhead is turned, due to bolt entering and wrench clearance, place a hardened round washer\non the bolt under the bolt head, and place the direct tension indicating washer on the bolt\nwith the protrusions against the hardened round washer.\n2 If it is necessary to place the direct tension indicating washer at the nut end, place it\non the bolt with protrusions facing toward the nut. Place a hardened round washer on the\nbolt against the protrusions, and install the nut. Turn the nut. When beveled washers\nare required, they may be used in conjunction with the direct tension indicating washer.\n3 Ensure that the surface contacting the protrusions does not turn during installation. Where\na direct tension indicating washer is used with a hardened round washer, some slight\nmovement of the round washer is acceptable.\n4 For oversize or slotted holes, use hardened washers in accordance with Subsection\n501.4.2.3.4.2, Washers.

The engineer may change the\nspecified elevation of the bottom of a drilled hole depending on where satisfactory\nmaterial is encountered.\n4 Blasting of bedrock in the drilled shaft hole will not be permitted.\n5 Use removable segmental casing, when necessary, to prevent caving or water\nseepage. Ensure that such casing is smooth, watertight, and made of metal strong enough\nto resist hydrostatic pressure, concrete pressure, and surrounding earth pressure. Ensure\nthat the casing is clean, extends to the top of the drilled shaft excavation, and has an outside\ndiameter not less than the specified diameter of the drilled hole. When the top of the drilled\nshaft is below ground level, use a removable oversize casing or other approved forming\nmethod from the ground surface to the shaft as required to control caving.\n6 If caving conditions are encountered, stop drilling and change methods.\n7 Do not use water for drilling mud or slurry without prior approval of the engineer.\n8 If encountered, remove subsurface obstructions at the drilled shaft locations.

After\npumping, discharge remaining concrete in the pipeline without contamination or\nsegregation.\n7 Keep chutes, troughs, and pipes clean by flushing with water after each run. Discharge\nflushing water away from the placed concrete.\n513.4.11.2 Consolidation\n1 Consolidate concrete with mechanical vibrators operating in the concrete; supplement\nby hand spading as necessary. Provide at least two vibrators at the site when placing\nmore than 10 yd³ [8 m³] of concrete. Work the concrete around the reinforcement and\nembedded fixtures and into form corners and angles. Do not use vibrators to flow or run\nconcrete into position. Vibrate concrete for a period long enough to compact but do not\ncause segregation.\n2 Insert the vibrator vertically with a distance between insertions of approximately 1 ½ times\nthe radius of influence, defined as the area visibly affected by the vibrator. Overlap\nadjacent radii of influence by approximately 2 in [50 mm]. With the vibrator, penetrate\nrapidly to the bottom of the layer and hold in place from 5 to 15 seconds. Stop vibrating\nin one location when large aggregate is embedded and escaping air bubbles stop\nappearing.\n513.4.11.3 Joints\n1 Locate construction joints as specified or approved by the engineer. For an\nemergency joint, form a keyway or insert dowel bars to provide adequate bond across the\njoint.\n2 Rough-float horizontal joints to consolidate the concrete surface; do not key. When\nplacing new concrete on the joint, draw the forms tight against existing concrete. Clean\nthe joint surface of foreign matter with wire brushes, brooms, or sand-blasting, and wet\nimmediately before placing concrete.\n3 Key vertical joints; form with oiled, beveled timber.\n4 Do not make joints with concrete sloping to a thin feathered edge. Use bulkheads for\nnonhorizontal joints and for horizontal joints that would otherwise lead to a feathered edge\n479",

Place\nthe first supports no more than 24 in [600 mm] from the centerline of girders, with\nother supports placed at bends with the same limits, not exceeding 4 ft [1.2 m], as\ndescribed for the bottom layer. When using individual high supports, place under\na longitudinal deck reinforcing bar in a continuous row, spaced no more than 4 ft\n[1.2 m] apart longitudinally.\nIf crank bar placement leaves the top mat of reinforcing too high to provide the\nspecified clearance, lay it over slightly.\n2. Cantilever Support for Truss-Bar Type Deck Slab Reinforcement. Support the\nbottom layer of reinforcing steel for the deck cantilever with continuous, longitudinal,\nslab-bolster type supports. If the cantilever exceeds 24 in [600 mm] from the\ncenterline of the exterior girder, place one support near the end of the cantilever and\none midway between the centerline of the exterior girder and the cantilever deck\nend.\nSupport the top layer of reinforcing steel with continuous, longitudinal, high-slab\nbolsters or individual high supports. Place the supports in the same manner as,\nand within the limits imposed for, the bottom layer of the cantilever.

Provide a shaping template for each size of pipe furnished.\nMatch the curvature of the template to the pipe bottom for a width of the outside diameter\ndivided by three. Use the shaping template to shape the loose bed course material in the\ncentral bedding zone without compacting the material in this zone.\nRemove sufficient material at each pipe protrusion such as joint bells to prevent stress\nconcentrations on joints. Tamp material outside the central bedding zone within the\nbedding limits after the pipe is placed. Backfill additional lifts of bed course material in\naccordance with Subsection 206.4.5, Backfilling. Backfill over-excavations in trench\nlocations with bed course material at no additional cost to the department.\n603.4.5 Installing Pipe\n1 Begin pipe installation at the downstream end. Ensure that the full length of each pipe\nsegment bottom is in contact with the shaped bedding. Place bell or groove ends of rigid\npipe and outside circumferential laps of flexible pipe facing upstream. Place flexible pipe\nwith longitudinal laps or seams at the sides. Place reinforced-concrete elliptical pipe with\nthe minor axis vertical and the major axis horizontal.\n2 After placing the pipe, compact bed course material outside of the central bedding zone\nto 95.0 percent of maximum density and within plus 2 percent to minus 4 percent of\noptimum moisture content. Do not compact material in the central bedding zone. If\nfoundation material is rock, increase minimum bedding thickness to 12 in [300 mm].\n603.4.6 Joining Pipe and End Sections\n603.4.6.1 General\n1 Use galvanized tie bolts, washers, and nuts.\n2 Rigid Pipe. Use bell-and-spigot or tongue-and-groove design. Join the sections with\nends tight and inner surfaces flush and even. If difficulty is encountered in making joints\ntight and flush, use bolted joint ties. On slopes of 10 percent or steeper, use bolted joint\nties or bell-and-spigot pipe. If water tight joints are specified, use rubber gaskets, mastic\nfiller or an external joint wrap which meets a laboratory test pressure of 10.8 psi in\naccordance AASHTO M315. If a wrap is chosen for the sole method of sealing, the wrap\nmust cover the entire circumference of the pipe and must be either an external sealing\nband that meets the requirements of ASTM C877 Type 1 or Type 2.\n3 Flexible (Metal) Pipe.

The department does not require certification for materials\nmanufactured by the contractor and tested by job control and check samples or by an\nauthorized testing agency.\n2 The engineer may approve the use of manufactured materials delivered to the site\nwithout the required certification(s) by approving in CMS if:\n1. The product has been precertified by the Materials Program;\n2. The product is on the Qualified Product List (QPL);\n3. The item costs less than $1500, meets the requirements stated in the Materials\nTesting Manual for approval of materials without certification, and is marked or\nlabeled with the brand name specified or the test specification to which it was\nmanufactured; or\n4. The use is temporary and the contractor retains ownership.\n3 In an emergency, the engineer may approve use of an item or items before the required\ncertifications have been received. The engineer will evaluate (and document) each\nsuch circumstance based on its own merits. For this purpose, the department considers an\nemergency as a condition requiring prompt action to protect the immediate safety or\nwelfare of the public. The use and incorporation of materials for emergency situations\nwithout the required certification does not constitute acceptance.\n800.2 Point of Sampling\n1 When directed by the engineer, obtain material samples for material acceptance in\naccordance with the Materials Testing Manual.
